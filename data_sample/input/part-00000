The truth isthat wood will shrink and expand with changes in humidity, and openings in a website finished flooring are a lot more noticeable compared to prefinished. When website finished floors shrinks in winter, the openings that develop will decode the end, which can be particularly true in broader boards.\nAlso, since the boards in a website finished flooring are stuck together by the end the gaps will grow at the weakest point in the end which may be every 3- 4 boards. This is called\"side bonding\" and doesn't occur in prefinished floors. In a prefinished flooring the boards are free to shrink individually so you've got little gaps between each plank, rather than large gaps randomly throughout your floor.\n","md5":"829eda6232acd94dfc392b0c5b238889","docid":"ccwarc_southwoodfordfloorsanding.blogspot.com_829eda6232acd94dfc392b0c5b238889","rand":0.8567736231124069}

{"content":"Vzala jsem zde kamarádku na narozeniny aby si užila trochu luxusu a samozřejmě jsme nebyly zklamané. Jsem sice zvyklá na rychlejší servis, ale v takovémto podniku by to bylo asi nemístné. Pánové číšníci byli perfektní profesionálové a kamarádce zařídili i malý dortík se svíčkou. Moc děkuji. Mělo to kýžený efekt. Restaurace každopádně na rande jako stvořená.\nServis, jídlo, prostředí, vše dokonalé. Stojí za návšťevu. Skvělý výběr vín. , ceny jsou odpodstatněné od kvality servisu a surovin. Highly recommended!!\nPromise you, your visit to Prague will be more memorable if you dine at this restaurant. It isn't cheap, but it is a very beautiful dining room which will make you feel like you are dining in a palace.\nThe food is very good and the staff are very kind and thoughtful.\nWe chose the Bohemia tasting menu, which I recommend.\nWe asked to swap a the roasted pork dish and they were did so readily, swapping it for quail. Also some of our party wanted the pairing wines and others didn't and they were happy to accommodate that as well.\nIf you want to experience what Prague probably felt like in its heyday, try U Maliru - it may end up being one of your top Prague vacation experiences.\nI was pleasantly surprised to find two good vegetarian main dishes, and the portions were all properly sized for a good appetite.\nOne of the best experience for fine dining not only in Praha but in Europe. One of the oldest restaurants in Prague, unique interior design with historical wall paintings, excellent waitresses and delicous menu accompanied by wonderful wine of select. Nothing more could be expected for a fine dining.\nWe had a lovely evening at U Maliru last week. We were welcomed into the restaurant by friendly waiting staff and the whole experience was very relaxed. They let us take our time to settle into the atmosphere and order an aperitif before even looking at the menu. The waiter introduced the menu with a short but informative history of the restaurant which was truly interesting. We ordered the foie gras and lobster bisque for starters which were both really tasty and then we shared the chateaubriand for main. The chateaubriand was flambéed at the table by the waiter and was done excellently. The amuse bouche and chocolates were a really nice touch. Amazing experience, amazing food and amazing service. Highly recommend.\nThe prices are very reasonable for such a good restaurant, especially if you take the lunch menu formula like we did. We were offered amuse-bouches, and traditional Czech bread that was constantly renewed. The personnel was absolutely lovely. They tended to us very politely and without any pressure, regularly checking on our glasses while remaining very discrete.\nThe food, of course, was amazing, and we were also graciously offered chocolates at the end of our meal. We wanted to try traditional Czech cuisine and we got it at its best.\nI absolutely recommend this restaurant. Will go again for sure!\nSo happy that we found this restaurant while in Prague. My husband and I wanted to have one really nice dinner to celebrate our trip and we could not have been happier. The restaurant itself is lovely, with some fun history but the staff was also great -very friendly and attentive, top notch service. And of course the food was also very impressive. It was all delicious and also presented beautifully. We both ordered a set menu and the whole thing was put together perfectly. We were offered an aperitif on arrival as well as an amuse bouche between courses and a lovely tray of chocolates arrived with the bill. These extra touches really impressed us and took a great experience to an excellent one. This is a more expensive restaurant by area standards but so worth it and real value for money! On all counts this was our favourite dinner while in Prague and we highly recommend it for a special evening out!\nWe are in Prague and wanted a great dinner to celebrate a birthday. We relied on the concierge at our hotel to recommend somewhere special. U Maliru exceeded our expectations. The old world ambience, top-flight service and truly spectacular food made the evening memorable: We all (3 persons) had the Exclusive Degustation Menu with wine pairings, which many might consider expensive and worth it!!! I encourage you to look at their menu for the specifics but will give an idea: 1: Beluga caviar, 2: grilled foie gras, 3: grilled pike perch (outstanding); 4: grilled veal loin (a bit over -cooked, and our only negative comment); 5: asst. cheeses, 5: strawberries flambeed tableside w\/ butter, grande mariner and chantilly cream. The wines were perfect for each course and we never would have known to select them.\nI want to thank Chef Dolezal for preparing such a remarkable meal, and to all of the gentlemen who so expertly served us one of the finest dining experiences we have ever had. I HIGHLY recommend U Maliru.\nWe got married in Prague and after the ceremony we had an event in the privet room of U MALIRU. if was PERFECT. the food was delicious, the place itself is beautiful, the staff was professional and David listened and fulfilled all our wishes! It was just all we could ask for. We also enjoyed a great music from a band that was playing for us!\nThank you for making our wedding event so unforgettable and amazing!\nNous y sommes allés, puis retournés !\nConseille dans le guide vert nous avons tenté ce petit restaurant un peu caché, et nous n'avons pas été déçu. Le décor à l'intérieur est très beau, le personnel accueillant n'hésite pas à nous raconter l'histoire des lieux.\nService et repas semi gastronomique. Des amuses bouches au dessert tout était parfait.\nJe vous conseille vivement le menu du midi très abordable et vraiment délicieux.\nWith my husband, and dear friends, we finished a trip to Prague at this very fine restaurant. We arrived around 10 PM following a chamber concert to find exceptional service, wonderful food, a very good wine list an warm, relaxing atmosphere.\nThough we arrived at a late hour, we were greeted with warmth and smiles followed by wonderful canapés.\nOur food was beautifully prepared and presented.\nI cannot over-recommend U Maliru 1543 to those willing to experience a wonderful Prague evening.\ndovolte mi, abych touto cestou poděkovala Vám i Vašemu týmu za možnost uspořádat v prostorách restaurace U Malířů 1453 společenské setkání vedení naší společnosti s významnými obchodními partnery. Nejen vedení, ale i naši partneři vysoce ocenili kuchyni, která je na špičkové úrovni, i přístup Vás i Vašich spolupracovníků v průběhu celého setkání, který byl velmi profesionální a zároveň nevtíravý.\nPo těchto zkušenostech se k Vám rádi vrátíme.\nWe spent 3 days in Prague, sampling the best Czech restaurants. This won on all accounts: best food, most beautiful setting and best service. Don't miss this restaurant on your trip to Prague.\nThank you once again for a wonderful evening last night. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their evening and the delicious food.\nvelmi Vám i celému týmu restaurace U Malířů 1543 děkujeme za vstřícnost a ochotu při přípravě slavnostního oběda pro významné hosty Velvyslanectví Japonska.\nDelegace byla velice spokojena jak s celým průběhem, tak i s chutí jednotlivých chodů. Hosté nám sdělili, že během své návštěvy České republiky jim ve Vaší restauraci chutnalo nejvíce.\nTěšíme se na další spolupráci a zůstáváme s pozdravem.\nMy friend took the bohemia tasting menu (tschek specialties) and i ate a starter (beetroot goatcheese quinoa) and a main course (potato gnochhi, black truffel and spinach) which were excellent. For no additional price we got four different kind of \"snacks\" between meals which also were excellent. And after dessert we also got three different kind of chocolates. Service was excellent and fast. Highly recommend this place!!! And the price was not bad at all!!\nYou will have to search a little to find this restaurant, it is located on a quiet square, in old Prague, but only a few minutes walk from Charles Bridge, but it will be well worth it. The food is delicious and well presented and the service is exemplary. The dining room is beautifully decorated with vaulted ceilings and wood panelling. They have a bottle of rather old Armagnac, which is worth a try if you have okayed with your bank manager beforehand! I would recommend this restaurant to any discerning diner.\neravamo in 4, i ragazzi hanno preso il menù Boemia composto da 3 portate più dolce, ed io e la mia amica abbiamo scelto à la carte.\nPiatti ricercati sia nell' impiattamento che nell'accostamento dei gusti (bravo lo chef)!!!\nDiscreta carta dei vini, internazionale.\nRistorante situato in una location storica.\nPrezzo molto sopra la media di Praga ma ne vale la pena.\nMy boyfriend invited me to the restaurant this week. I have never seen such a beautiful place like that at all. Nice paintings, new bar as a reception and warm atmosphere. We had 2 Exclusive menus. What to say - WOW. Great food, brilliant wine pairing, educated and friendly service. The prices are higher, but the perfect cuisine and ambience will take you to the heaven.\nThis is a beautiful restaurant in a heart of the old Prague. It's suitable for romantic dinner for two or party of large groups. We came for lunch and choose the lunch menu which was fantastic. We also checked the dinner menu because we'd definitely come back in the future. Food is inspired by French influence with Czech twist and is beautifully presented. All courses are carefully matched with wine from extensive cellar and recommended by very knowledgeable sommelier. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to dine in style.\nOn a quiet square, just south off Charles bridge, on the left bank. Hadn't seen the listing, attracted by the interesting menu offer though ended up selecting the St Martin's special menu, based on goose. It did not disappoint, varied, and not heavy, accompanied by an excellent Czech merlot. And their crémant is super ! One of our group is a light eater, so, without saying, chose vegetarian alternatives, and, unprompted, the amuse bouche offered was too! Service unobtrusive, quite informal, and well timed. All in, more expensive than many others, yes, but well worth it for fine and memorable dining in historic surroundings.\nCe restaurant est à l'image de cette ville merveilleuse. Plats, vins, cadre, professionnalisme du personnel se confondent et on y passe un moment des plus agréables.\nNous avons apprécié le menu du jour servi même pour le dîner (rare) de composition harmonieuse et accompagné d'un vin excellent recommandé par le sommelier.\nTout cela pour un prix tout à fait raisonnable.\nNous avons découvert ce merveilleux restaurant par hasard, pas loin de la maison ou logeait Chateaubriand lors de sa visite a Prague en 1833.\nCe vieux cartier concentre les richesses architecturales, en commençant par le château et sa cathédrale et se terminant par le célèbre pont Charles.\nLe restaurant « U Maliru », nous l´avons appris plus tard, existait déjà dans cette vielle maison en l´an 1543.\nSon intérieur marie parfaitement les temps passés, les fresques de début de 20ème siècle et l´élégance d´un restaurant gastronomique.\nLe personnel nous accueillit avec sourire et nous a placé à une belle table, près de la cheminé.\nNous avons choisit le menu tchèque et étions agréablement surpris par sa composition harmonieuse et l´expression succulente de plats.\nLe personnel de salle est professionnel et nous guidait judicieusement dans le choix des vins.\nNous avons passé une soirée inoubliable, nous revisiterons sûrement Prague très bientôt et, par gourmandise, retournerons au restaurant « U Maliru » !\nThis place is quite fancy and expensive, but they live up to the expectations! Two years ago I tried my first beef tartare here and was amazed at how tasty it was. This visit they didn't have it on the menu, but kindly offered to prepare it for us. Once again it was more than great and we even found the time to go there again during our short stay. The stuff is friendly and open, the quality of food was really good. We went both times to get lunch and there always was a table or two free, but I can't say how busy it might get at the dinner time.\nThe little homemade bread buns and butter that come first were already delicious, so was everything else.\nIt is pretty pricey, but we felt it was appropriate for what we received.\nP.S: compliments to the Chef for his great tartare-mixing talent!\nThis was close to the Aria Hotel where we stayed. We just stumbled upon it one night, peeked in, and were taken by the absolute beauty of this place. The age of the restaurant, the hand painted walls and ceiling makes it visually unlike any restaurant I have ever experienced. The food was terrific too...An absolute must. One of the oldest restaurants in Europe.","md5":"3abd78aef06edf190e82e890d14ea7dc","docid":"redpajama_c4_3abd78aef06edf190e82e890d14ea7dc","rand":0.8567736240702469}

According to Murua, Manco’s relative and rival Pascac, who had sided with the Spaniards, gave advice about the plan of attack. It was decided that Juan Pizarro would lead fifty horsemen – the greater part of the Spaniards’ cavalry-in a desperate attempt to break through the besiegers and attack their fortress. Observers from the Indian side remembered the scene as follows:’ They spent the whole of that night on their knees and with their hands clasped [in prayer] at their mouths – for many Indians saw them. Even those on guard in the square did the same, as did many Indians who were on their side and had accompanied them from Cajamarca. On the following morning, very early, they all emerged from the church [Suntur Huasi] and mounted their horses as if they were going to fight. They started to look from side to side. While they were looking about in this way, they suddenly put spurs to their horses and at full gallop, despite the enemy, broke through the opening which had been sealed like a wall, and charged off up the hillside at breakneck speed.’ They broke through the northern Chinchaysuyo contingent under the generals Curiatao and Pusca. Juan Pizarro’s horsemen then galloped up the Jauja road, climbing the hill through Carmenca. They somehow broke and fought their way through the native barricades. Pedro Pizarro was in that contingent and recalled the dangerous ride, zigzagging up the hillside. The Indians had mined the road with pits, and the Spaniards’ native auxiliaries had to fill these in with adobes while the horsemen waited under fire from the hillside. But the Spaniards eventually struggled up on to the plateau and rode off to the north-west. The natives thought that they were making a dash for freedom, and sent runners across country to order the destruction of the Apurímac suspension bridge. But at the village of Jicatica the horsemen left the road and wheeled to the right, fought through the gullies behind the hills of Queancalla and Zenca, and reached the level plain below the terraces of Sacsahuaman. Only by this broad flanking movement were the Spaniards able to avoid the mass of obstacles that the Indians had erected on the direct routes between the city and its fortress.\nThe Indians had also used the few weeks since the start of the siege to defend the level ‘parade ground’ beyond Sacsahuaman with an earth barrier that the Spaniards described as a barbican. Gonzalo Pizarro and Hernán Ponce de León led one troop in repeated attacks on these outer enclosures. Some of the horses were wounded, and two Spaniards were thrown from their mounts and almost captured in the maze of rocky outcrops. ‘It was a moment when much was at stake.’ Juan Pizarro therefore attacked with all his men in support of his brother. Together they succeeded in forcing the barricades and riding into the space before the massive terrace walls. Whenever the Spaniards approached these they were greeted by a withering fire of slingshots and javelins. One of Juan Pizarro’s pages was killed by a heavy stone. It was late afternoon, and the attackers were exhausted by the day’s fierce fighting. But Juan Pizarro attempted one last charge, a frontal attack on the main gate into the fortress. This gate was defended by side walls projecting on either side, and the natives had dug a defensive pit between them. The passage leading to the gate was crowded with Indians defending the entrance or attempting to retreat from the barbican into the main fortress.\nJuan Pizarro had been struck on the jaw during the previous day’s fighting in Cuzco and was unable to wear his steel helmet. As he charged towards the gate in the setting sun, he was struck on the head by a stone hurled from the salient walls. It was a mortal blow. The Governor’s younger brother, corregidor of Cuzco and tormentor of Inca Manco, was carried down to Cuzco that night in great secrecy, to prevent the natives learning of their success. He lived long enough to dictate a will, on 16 May 1536, ‘being sick in body but sound of mind’. He made his younger brother Gonzalo heir to his vast fortune, in the hope that he would found an entail, and left bequests to religious foundations and to the poor in Panama and his birthplace Trujillo. He made no mention of the native siege, and left nothing to the Indian woman from whom ‘I have received services’ and ‘who has given birth to a girl whom I do not recognise as my daughter.’ Francisco de Pancorvo recalled that ‘they buried him by night so that the Indians should not know he was dead, for he was a very brave man and the Indians were very frightened of him. But although the death of Juan Pizarro was [supposed to be] a secret, the Indians used to say “Now that Juan Pizarro is dead” just as one would say “Now that the brave are dead”. And he was indeed dead.’ Alonso Enríquez de Guzman gave a more materialistic epitaph: ‘They killed our Captain Juan Pizarro, a brother of the Governor and a young man of twenty-five who possessed a fortune of 200,000 ducats.’\nOn the following day the natives counter-attacked repeatedly. Large numbers of warriors tried to dislodge Gonzalo Pizarro from the hillock opposite the terraces of Sacsahuaman. ‘There was terrible confusion. Everyone was shouting and they were all entangled together, fighting for the hilltop the Spaniards had won. It looked as though the whole world was up there grappling in close combat.’ Hernando Pizarro sent twelve of his remaining horsemen up to join the critical battle – to the dismay of the few Spaniards left in Cuzco. Manco Inca sent five thousand reinforcements, and ‘the Spaniards were in a very tight situation with their arrival, for the Indians were fresh and attacked with determination.’ Below ‘in the city, the Indians mounted such a fierce attack that the Spaniards thought themselves lost a thousand times’.\nBut the Spaniards were about to apply European methods of siege warfare: throughout the day they had been making scaling ladders. As night fell, Hernando Pizarro himself led an infantry force to the top of the hill. Using the scaling ladders in a night assault, the Spaniards succeeded in taking the mighty terrace walls of the fortress. The natives retreated into the complex of buildings and the three great towers.\nThere were two individual acts of great bravery during this final stage of the assault. On the Spanish side Hernán’Sánchez of Badajoz, one of the twelve brought up by Hernando Pizarro as additional reinforcements, performed feats of prodigious panache worthy of a silent-screen hero. He climbed one of the scaling ladders under a hail of stones which he parried with his buckler, and squeezed into a window of one of the buildings. He hurled himself at the Indians inside and sent them retreating up some stairs towards the roof. He now found himself at the foot of the highest tower. Fighting round its base he came upon a thick rope that had been left dangling from the top. Commending himself to God, he sheathed his sword and started clambering up, heaving up the rope with his hands and stepping off from the smooth Inca ashlars with his feet. Half way up the Indians threw a stone ‘as big as a wine jar’ down on him, but it simply glanced off the buckler he was wearing on his back. He threw himself into one of the higher levels of the tower, suddenly appearing in the midst of its startled defenders, showed himself to the other Spaniards and encouraged them to assault the other tower.\nThe battle for the terraces and buildings of Sacsahuaman was hard fought. ‘When dawn came, we spent the whole of that day and the next fighting the Indians who had retreated into the two tall towers. These could only be taken through thirst, when their water supply became exhausted.’ ‘They fought hard that day and throughout the night. When the following day dawned, the Indians on the inside began to weaken, for they had exhausted their entire store of stones and arrows.’ The native commanders, Paucar Huaman and the high priest Villac Umu, felt that there were too many defenders inside the citadel, whose supplies of food and water were rapidly being exhausted. ‘After dinner one evening, almost at the hour of vespers, they emerged from the fortress with great élan, attacked their enemies and broke through them. They rushed with their men down the slope towards Zapi and climbed to Carmenca.’ Escaping through the ravine of the Tullumayo, they hurried to Manco’s camp at Calca to plead for reinforcements. If the remaining two thousand defenders could hold Sacsahuaman, a native counter-attack might trap the Spaniards against its mighty walls.\nVillac Umu left the defence of Sacsahuaman to an Inca noble, an orejón who had sworn to fight to the death against the Spaniards. This officer now rallied the defenders almost single-handed, performing feats of bravery ‘worthy of any Roman’. ‘The orejón strode about like a lion from side to side of the tower on its topmost level. He repulsed any Spaniards who tried to mount with scaling ladders. And he killed any Indians who tried to surrender. He smashed their heads with the battle-axe he was carrying and hurled them from the top of the tower.’ Alone of the defenders, he possessed European steel weapons that made him the match of the attackers in hand-to-hand fighting. ‘He carried a buckler on his arm, a sword in one hand and a battle-axe in the shield hand, and wore a Spanish morrión helmet on his head.’ ‘Whenever his men told him that a Spaniard was climbing up somewhere, he rushed upon him like a lion with the sword in his hand and the shield on his arm.’ ‘He received two arrow wounds but ignored them as if he had not been touched.’ Hernando Pizarro arranged for the towers to be attacked simultaneously by three or four scaling ladders. But he ordered that the brave orejón should be captured alive. The Spaniards pressed home their attack, assisted by large contingents of native auxiliaries. As Manco’s son wrote, ‘the battle was a bloody affair for both sides, because of the many natives who were supporting the Spaniards. Among these were two of my father’s brothers called Inquill and Huaspar with many of their followers, and many Chachapoyas and Cañari Indians.’ As the native resistance crumbled, the orejón hurled his weapons down on to the attackers in a frenzy of despair. He grabbed handfuls of earth, stuffed them into his mouth and scoured his face in anguish, then covered his head with his cloak and leaped to his death from the top of the fortress, in fulfilment of his pledge to the Inca.\n‘With his death the remainder of the Indians gave way, so that Hernando Pizarro and all his men were able to enter. They put all those inside the fortress to the sword-there were 1,500 of them.’ Many others flung themselves from the walls. ‘Since these were high the men who fell first died. But some of those who fell later survived because they landed on top of a great heap of dead men.’ The mass of corpses lay unburied, a prey for vultures and giant condors. The coat of arms of the city of Cuzco, granted in 1540, had ‘an orle of eight condors, which are great birds like vultures that exist in the province of Peru, in memory of the fact that when the castle was taken these birds descended to eat the natives who had died in it’.\nHernando Pizarro immediately garrisoned Sacsahuaman with a force of fifty foot-soldiers supported by Cañari auxiliaries. Pots of water and food were hurried up from the city. The high priest Villac Umu returned with reinforcements, just too late to save the citadel. He counter-attacked vigorously, and the battle for Sacsahuaman continued fiercely for three more days, but the Spaniards were not dislodged, and the battle was won by the end of May.\nBoth sides appreciated that the recapture of Sacsahuaman could be a turning point in the siege. The natives now had no secure base from which to invest the city, and they abandoned some of the outlying districts they had occupied. When the counter-attack on Sacsahuaman failed, the Spaniards advanced out of the citadel and pursued the demoralised natives as far as Calca. Manco and his military commanders could not understand why their vast levies had failed to capture Cuzco. His son Titu Cusi imagined a dialogue between the Inca and his commanders. Manco:’ You have disappointed me. There were so many of you and so few of them, and yet they have eluded your grasp.’ To which the generals replied, ‘We are so ashamed that we dare not look you in the face…. We do not know the reason, except that it was our mistake not to have attacked in time and yours for not giving us permission to do so.’\nThe generals might possibly have been right. Manco’s insistence on waiting for the entire army to assemble meant that the Indians lost the element of surprise they had preserved so brilliantly during the early mobilisation. It also meant that the professional commanders could not attack while the Spaniards had sent much of their best cavalry to investigate the Yucay valley. The hordes of native militia did not necessarily add much to the effectiveness of the native army. But Manco had clearly felt that as long as his men suffered a terrible handicap in weapons, armour and mobility, their only hope of defeating the Spaniards was by weight of numbers. The heavy, determined fighting of the first month of the siege showed that the Spaniards had no monopoly of personal bravery. Once again, it was their crushing superiority in hand-to-hand fighting and the mobility of their horses that won the day. The only arms in which the natives had parity were projectiles – slingshots, arrows, javelins and bolas – and prepared defences such as breastworks, terraces, flooding and pits. But projectiles and defences rarely succeeded in killing an armoured Spaniard, and the siege of Cuzco was a fight to the death.\nManco could also be criticised for not directing the attack on Cuzco in person. He apparently remained at his headquarters at Calca throughout the critical first month of the siege. He was using his authority and energies to effect the almost impossible feat of a simultaneous uprising throughout Peru, together with the feeding and supply of an enormous army. But the Inca’s presence was needed at Cuzco. Although there were plenty of imposing fighting men in the various contingents, the army lacked the inspiration of a leader of the stature of Chalcuchima, Quisquis or Rumiñavi.\nThe fall of Sacsahuaman at the end of May was by no means the end of the siege. Manco’s great army remained in close investiture of the city for a further three months. The Spaniards soon learned that the native attacks ceased for religious celebrations at every new moon. They took full advantage of each lull to destroy roofless houses, fill in enemy pits, and repair their own defences. There was fighting throughout this period, with great bravery displayed on either side.\nOne episode will illustrate the typical daily skirmishes. Pedro Pizarro was on guard duty with two other horsemen on one of the large agricultural terraces at the edge of Cuzco. At midday his commander, Hernán Ponce de León, came out with food and asked Pedro Pizarro to undertake another tour of duty as he had no one else to send. Pizarro duly grabbed some mouthfuls of food and rode out to another terrace to join Diego Maldonado, Juan Clemente and Francisco de la Puente on guard.\nWhile they were chatting together, some Indian warriors approached. Maldonado rode off after them. But he had failed to see some pits the natives had prepared, and his horse fell into one. Pedro Pizarro dashed off against the Indians, avoiding the pits, and gave Maldonado and his horse, both badly injured, a chance to return to Cuzco. The Indians re-appeared to taunt the three remaining horsemen. Pizarro suggested ‘Come on, let’s drive these Indians away and try to catch some of them. Their pits are now behind us.’ The three charged off. His two companions turned half way along the terrace, and returned to their post, but Pizarro galloped on ‘impetuously lancing Indians’. At the end of the terrace the natives had prepared small holes to catch the horses’ hooves. When he tried to wheel, Pizarro’s horse caught its leg and threw him. One Indian rushed up and started to lead off the horse, but Pizarro got to his feet, went after the man and killed him with a thrust through the chest. The horse bolted, running off to join the other Spaniards. Pizarro now defended himself with his shield and sword, holding off any Indians who drew near. His companions saw his riderless horse and hurried to help him. They charged through the Indians, ‘caught me between their horses, told me to grab the stirrups, and took off at full speed for some distance. But there were so many Indians crowding around that it was useless. Wearied from all my armour and from fighting, I could not go on running. I shouted to my companions to stop as I was being throttled. I preferred to die fighting than be choked to death. So I stopped and turned to fight the Indians, and the two on their horses did the same. We could not drive off the Indians, who had become very bold at the thought that they had taken me prisoner. They all gave a great shout from every side, which was their normal practice when they captured a Spaniard or a horse. Gabriel de Rojas, who was returning to his quarters with ten horsemen, heard this shout and looked in the direction of the disturbance and the fighting. He hurried there with his men, and I was saved by his arrival, although badly wounded by the stone and spear blows inflicted by the Indians. I and my horse were saved in this way, with the help of our Lord God who gave me strength to fight and to endure the strain.’\nGabriel de Rojas received an arrow wound in one of these skirmishes: it went through his nose as far as his palate. Garcia Martin had his eye knocked out by a stone. One Cisneros dismounted, and the Indians caught him and cut off his hands and feet. ‘I can bear witness’, wrote Alonso Enriquez de Guzman, ‘ that this was the most dreadful and cruel war in the world. For between Christians and Moors there is some fellow-feeling, and it is in the interests of both sides to spare those they take alive because of their ransoms. But in this Indian war there is no such feeling on either side. They give each other the cruellest deaths they can imagine.’ Cieza de Leon echoed this. The war was ‘fierce and horrible. Some Spaniards tell that a great many Indians were burned and impaled…. But God save us from the fury of the Indians, which is something to be feared when they can give vent to it!’ The natives had no monopoly of cruelty. Hernando Pizarro ordered his men to kill any women they caught during the fighting. The idea was to deprive the fighting men of the women who did so much to serve and carry for them. ‘This was done from then onwards, and the stratagem worked admirably and caused much terror. The Indians feared to lose their wives, and the latter feared to die.’ This war on the women was thought to have been one of the chief reasons for the slackening of the siege in August 1536. On one sortie Gonzalo Pizarro encountered a contingent from the Chinchaysuyo and captured two hundred of them. ‘The right hands were cut off all these men in the middle of the square. They were then released so that they would go off. This acted as a dreadful warning to the rest.’\nSuch tactics added to the demoralisation of Manco’s army. The vast majority of the horde that massed on the hills around Cuzco were ordinary Indian farmers with their wives and camp followers – with few exceptions a thoroughly militia army, most of whose men had received only the rudimentary arms drill that was part of the upbringing of every Inca subject. Only part of this rabble was militarily effective, although the entire mass had to be fed. By August the farmers began drifting away to sow their crops. Their departure added to the attrition of heavy losses in every battle against the Spaniards. Weight of numbers was Manco’s only effective strategy, so the reduction of his great army meant that further operations against Cuzco might have to wait until the following year. But Cuzco was only one theatre of the national uprising. In other areas the natives were far more successful.","md5":"8c47dccf8ecf5896bd44821e945fd825","docid":"ccwarc_weaponsandwarfare.com_8c47dccf8ecf5896bd44821e945fd825","rand":0.8567736420154799}

During the following years, technical advances (microprocessors and memory chips) allowed games such as Space Invaders or Asteroids to appear in arcade machines.\nThe 80s began strongly due to the popularity of these machines and the first video game consoles. However, in 1983 the video game crisis broke out, affecting the United States and Canada, until 1985. Japan opted for consoles with the Famicom (Nintendo Entertainment System), launched in 1983 while Europe opted for microcomputers (Commodore 64 or Spectrum).\nIn the late 1980s, 16-bit consoles appeared and microcomputers were slowly replaced by personal computers with IBM architecture. In 1985 came Super Mario Bros, a turning point in the development of electronic games. In the early 90’s, video game consoles took a significant leap thanks to the competition of the so-called “16-bit generation” made up of the Mega Drive, the Super Nintendo Entertainment, PC Engine and CPS Changer. This generation boosted the number of players and favored the entry of technologies such as CDROM. 3D video games were occupying an important place in the market, especially due to the so-called “32-bit generation” on the PlayStation and Saturn and the “64-bit generation” on the Nintendo 64 and Atari Jaguar.\nTowards the end of the 90s, the most popular console was the PlayStation with games like Final Fantasy VII or Resident Evil. On PC, action games (Quake, Unreal or Half-Life) and real-time strategy games (Command & Conquer or Warcrafy, and Starcraft) were popular. Connections between computers via the internet facilitated multiplayer and role-playing games like Ultima Online. In 1998 the Dreamcast appeared in Japan, beginning the “128-bit generation”.\nIn 2000 Sony launched the PlayStation2 and Sega another console with Dreamcast features, but with a 14 ”monitor, keyboard, speakers and the same controls called Dreamcast Drivers 2000 Series CX-1. Microsoft came in creating the Xbox in 2001, Nintendo the Gamecube, and the first completely new Game Boy since the company’s inception, the Game Boy Advance. Seeing that it could not compete, Sega announced in 2002 that it would focus on software developer.\nThe seventh generation includes consoles released since late 2005 by Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii). In 2010, Sony launched the PlayStation Move, with motion sensor and Microsoft Kinect (Guinness Record of sales).\nThe eighth generation is made up of Nintendo’s Wii U, Sony’s PlayStation 4 and 5, and Microsoft’s Xbox One, in addition to PCs, Androids, and Tablets. Among the improvements they have brought we must highlight virtual reality and multiplayer games. For example, in 2017, Epic released the new version of “Save the World” for free: Fortnite: Battle Royale. More than 10 million users were connected in the first two weeks of launch, being in 2020 at the top of the list of games with the highest number of concurrent players (12.3 million).","md5":"152c337ba3e55713f2d9056e47349ade","docid":"ccwarc_www.revistanuclear.es_152c337ba3e55713f2d9056e47349ade","rand":0.8567736518566524}

Alongside other metrics and information, these enable investors to evaluate funds on certain environmental, social and governance characteristics. Sustainability Characteristics do not provide an indication of current or future performance nor do they represent the potential risk and reward profile of a fund. They are provided for transparency and for information purposes only. Sustainability Characteristics should not be considered solely or in isolation, but instead are one type of information that investors may wish to consider when assessing a fund.\nThe metrics are not indicative of how or whether ESG factors will be integrated into a fund. Unless otherwise stated in fund documentation and included within a fund’s investment objective, the metrics do not change a fund’s investment objective or constrain the fund’s investable universe, and there is no indication that an ESG or Impact focused investment strategy or exclusionary screens will be adopted by a fund. For more information regarding a fund's investment strategy, please see the fund's prospectus.\nReview the MSCI methodologies behind Sustainability Characteristics using the links below.\nTo be included in MSCI ESG Fund Ratings, 65% of the fund’s gross weight must come from securities with ESG coverage by MSCI ESG Research (certain cash positions and other asset types deemed not relevant for ESG analysis by MSCI are removed prior to calculating a fund’s gross weight; the absolute values of short positions are included but treated as uncovered), the fund’s holdings date must be less than one year old, and the fund must have at least ten securities. For newly launched funds, Sustainability Characteristics are typically available 6 months after launch.\nBusiness Involvement\nBusiness Involvement\nBusiness Involvement metrics can help investors gain a more comprehensive view of specific activities in which a fund may be exposed through its investments.\nBusiness Involvement metrics are not indicative of a fund’s investment objective, and, unless otherwise stated in fund documentation and included within a fund’s investment objective, do not change a fund’s investment objective or constrain the fund’s investable universe, and there is no indication that an ESG or Impact focused investment strategy or exclusionary screens will be adopted by a fund. For more information regarding a fund's investment strategy, please see the fund's prospectus.\nReview the MSCI methodology behind the Business Involvement metrics, using links below.\nBusiness Involvement metrics are calculated by BlackRock using data from MSCI ESG Research which provides a profile of each company’s specific business involvement. BlackRock leverages this data to provide a summed up view across holdings and translates it to a fund's market value exposure to the listed Business Involvement areas above.\nWhile BlackRock calculates the business involvement metrics based on data from MSCI ESG Research, the fund seeks to replicate the performance of an index not provided by MSCI. As a result, MSCI may take a different view on the business involvement exposure of a fund’s underlying holdings than the fund’s index provider. The fund’s index provider may also implement business involvement screens with a similar exposure as the business involvement metrics but apply a different methodology. Consequently, the business involvement metrics may indicate exposure to a category that is subject to an exclusionary screen by the fund’s index methodology.\nBusiness Involvement metrics are designed only to identify companies where MSCI has conducted research and identified as having involvement in the covered activity. As a result, it is possible there is additional involvement in these covered activities where MSCI does not have coverage. This information should not be used to produce comprehensive lists of companies without involvement. Business Involvement metrics are only displayed if at least 1% of the fund’s gross weight includes securities covered by MSCI ESG Research.\nHoldings\nHoldings\n|Issuer||Weight (%)|\n|HUNGARY (GOVERNMENT)||4.27|\n|SAUDI ARABIA (KINGDOM OF)||4.10|\n|PANAMA REPUBLIC OF (GOVERNMENT)||3.91|\n|URUGUAY (ORIENTAL REPUBLIC OF)||3.77|\n|PHILIPPINES (REPUBLIC OF)||3.68|\n|Issuer||Weight (%)|\n|BRAZIL FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF (GOVERNMENT)||3.56|\n|QATAR (STATE OF)||3.44|\n|ROMANIA (REPUBLIC OF)||3.32|\n|DOMINICAN REPUBLIC (GOVERNMENT)||3.29|\n|COLOMBIA (REPUBLIC OF)||3.08|\nExposure Breakdowns\nExposure Breakdowns\nSecurities Lending\nSecurities Lending\nSecurities lending is an established and well regulated activity in the investment management industry. It involves the transfer of securities (such as shares or bonds) from a Lender (in this case, the iShares fund) to a third-party (the Borrower). The Borrower will give the Lender collateral (the Borrower’s pledge) in the form of shares, bonds or cash, and will also pay the Lender a fee. This fee provides additional income for the fund and thus can help to reduce the total cost of ownership of an ETF.\nAt BlackRock, securities lending is a core investment management function with dedicated trading, research and technology capabilities. The lending programme is designed to deliver superior absolute returns to clients, whilst maintaining a low risk profile. Funds participating in securities lending retain 62.5% of the income, while BlackRock receives 37.5% of the income and covers all the operational costs resulting from securities lending transactions.\nThe information in the Lending Summary table will not be displayed for the funds that have participated in securities lending for less than 12 months. The figures shown relate to past performance. Past performance is not a reliable indication of current or future results.\nBlackRock’s policy is to disclose performance information quarterly subject to a one-month delay. This means that returns from 01\/01\/2019 to 31\/12\/2019 can be publicly disclosed from 01\/02\/2020.\nMaximum on-loan figure may increase or decrease over time.\nWith securities lending there is a risk of loss should the borrower default before the securities are returned, and due to market movements, the value of collateral held has fallen and\/or the value of the securities on loan has risen.\n|Ticker||Name||Asset Class||Weight %||ISIN||SEDOL||Exchange||Country|\nThe information in the Collateral Holdings table relates to securities obtained in the collateral basket under the securities lending programme for the fund in question. The information contained in this material is derived from proprietary and non-proprietary sources deemed by BlackRock to be reliable, is not necessarily all inclusive and is not guaranteed as to accuracy. Reliance upon information in this material is at the sole discretion of the reader. The primary risk in securities lending is that a borrower will default on their commitment to return lent securities while the value of the liquidated collateral does not exceed the cost of repurchasing the securities and the fund suffers a loss in respect of the short-fall.\nThe below table shows the Loan\/Collateral Combinations and Collateral Levels for our European Lending funds.\n|Collateral Types|\n|Loan Type||Equities||Government, Supranational and Agency Bonds||Cash (Not for Reinvestment)|\n|Equities||105%-112%||105%-106%||105%-108%|\n|Government Bonds||110%-112%||102.5%-106%||102.5%-105%|\n|Corporate Bonds||110%-112%||104%-106%||103.5%-105%|\nWe also accept selected physically replicating Equity, Government Bond, Credit and Commodity ETFs as collateral.\nCollateral parameters depend on the collateral and the loan combination, and the over collateralisation level may range from 102.5% to 112%. In this context, “Over Collateralisation” means that the aggregate market value of collateral taken will exceed the overall on-loan value. Collateral parameters are reviewed on an ongoing bases and are subject to change.\nWith securities lending there is a risk of loss should the borrower default before the securities are returned, and due to market movements, the value of collateral held has fallen and\/or the value of the securities on loan has risen.\nListings\nListings\n|Exchange||Ticker||Currency||Listing Date||SEDOL||Bloomberg Ticker||RIC||Bloomberg INAV||Reuters INAV||ISIN||WKN||Valoren||Common Code (EOC)||ISIN of INAV|\n|Bolsa Institucional de Valores||EMEMX||MXN||Jan 27, 2022||BLGX1Y0||-||-||-||-||IE000M51EY66||-||-||-||-|\n","md5":"a644986466c63c732e0fe205a96ae7f4","docid":"ccwarc_www.blackrock.com_a644986466c63c732e0fe205a96ae7f4","rand":0.8567736544348544}

For this reason, the concept of nominal distribution establishes a probability that has a certain sequence with trials between the final result, which will be success, or as we discussed, failure.\nWhat is the formula for the binomial distribution?\nThe formula for the binomial distribution is the one we find below. Before knowing it, it is important to take into account what each value of the binomial distribution represents, and of all the elements that compose it \"p\" will be success, \"q\" will be failure and \"n\" will represent the number of trials and experiments that are carried out. Finally \"x\" will refer to the total number of successes achieved.\nHowever, when calculating the formula for the nominal distribution, it must be taken into account that the final result will be completely independent of those that may have been achieved previously.\nFinally, we must also take into account the presence of certain parameters, such as the variance, the standard deviation and the mean:\n- Variance: µ = n. P\n- Media: o2 = n. p. q\n- Desviación típica: o = √npq\nWhat are the characteristics of the binomial distribution?\nOne of the main characteristics of the binomial distribution is that always the probability of success that is given by \"p\" is a constant. Therefore, to carry out this experiment, tests will always be needed. Therefore, for each of the trials or tests carried out throughout the experiment, there will only be a total of two possible results, success or failure. Of course, the probability of failure must also be constant.\nAnother of the properties of the binominal distribution that we must highlight is that the events are exclusive, because as we have commented, the two results cannot be given, or we find ourselves with success or we find ourselves with failure. However, we will always find a random variable. In this case, the random will always be the number of experiments performed.","md5":"6cb7f12364da6effd7197e13e4e720d7","docid":"ccwarc_www.infocomm.ky_6cb7f12364da6effd7197e13e4e720d7","rand":0.8567736584969788}

{"content":"Nicholas Jacob Architects becomes an LLP\nNJ Architects has long operated as a partnership of sorts – driven by the ambition, vision and passion of its founder and principal Nick Jacob and lead associate Shaun Soanes. Now, with a host of exciting plans for the future, it is set to make that partnership official.\nToday marks a significant point in the business development of NJ Architects.\nAs of April 1, we will officially become a Limited Liability Partnership – a move which will support the growth of the company and allow new partners Nick and Shaun to make operational decisions with more agility.\nIn addition, it will bolster plans to expand, helping us to attract new talent as well as provide greater opportunities for existing staff.\nWhat does it mean?\nPartnerships are very common when two individuals work together to build a business. An LLP creates a great structure for any company that currently operates with a small and consistent number of members who each make comparable contributions. Furthermore, this type of partnership structure – no shares, shareholders, or directors – allows for greater flexibility than any other.\nWhy switch?\nLLPs have existed in the UK since 2000 and were designed to promote the growth of partnerships by providing limited liability and a separate legal identity, while maintaining the tax treatment received by partnerships. They also have other key benefits, such as sense of ownership in the business and flexibility in management and pay structures.\nSo why switch now?\nWell, the truth is our practice has been a partnership of sorts for many years now. After all, while Nick Jacob founded the company in 1996, he has worked with Shaun Soanes, who provides expert advice on conservation and historic buildings, challenging contemporary builds and larger projects, throughout.\nThe pair have worked together to grow the company from humble beginnings to a multi-award winning firm of professionals, positioning it as a leader in the market place. The main driver for the change to LLP therefore has been the ability to grow the ownership of the practice in a structured way and create the opportunity for individuals to take the initiative. This should lead to new areas of growth as well as generate a sense of pride among the senior management team.\nThe future is bright\nBecoming an LLP requires vision from the top. But it is also about supporting people with drive and passion to grow the business from the bottom up.\nNick Jacobs said: “We are very excited about the future.\nShaun Soanes said: “We plan to continue delivering work to the highest of standards, with the support of our fantastic team and clients.”\nLeave a ReplyWant to join the discussion?\nFeel free to contribute!","url":"https:\/\/www.njarchitects.co.uk\/about-us\/nicholas-jacob-architects-becomes-llp\/","timestamp":"2020-07-02 17:42:05","dump":"CC-MAIN-2020-29","segment":"1593655878639.9","md5":"d6478ed2cda305e53ea368c69e1bb014","docid":"falcon_www.njarchitects.co.uk_d6478ed2cda305e53ea368c69e1bb014","rand":0.8567736626818262}

It is located close to Killarney town centre and next door to the iconic St. Mary's Cathedral. The ground floor of the building and two rooms upstairs provide a varied day service programme for a large group of people (using amenities in the town and its environs) . The staff at this Centre design and implement a range of training programmes appropriate to people's needs, ie. art & craft, catering, household and community integration skills. People supported by KPFA are given opportunities to develop greater awareness about crime and personal safety, road safety and self-advocacy among a wide range of extra courses offered.\nThe Community Programme (CP) in Park Court provides opportunities to those supported to develop skills in a number of areas, including independent living, personal safety, community integration, interpersonal skills, and exploring employment. Trainees also learn about money management, budgeting and using the ATM. The Park Court Community Programme works in conjunction with KPFA Job Coaches, Nala and local businesses in Killarney to develop IT skills, and expand on work experience placement options locally.\nThe Aras Phádraig Centre is a day service community programme which is open five days a week (Monday to Friday). This KPFA Killarney-based Community Programme caters for up to 23 adults, most of whom live at home with their families. The group have local access to shops, leisure centres, hotels, hairdressers, bus and train stations and other facilities nearby and are also fortunate to be close to the library, post office, banks, churches, parish hall and community adult education facilities. The building has a parking area, kitchen, laundry facilities, shower and toilets, large dining area, tv\/relaxation room and a computer\/training room. A staggered and varied timetable includes employment opportunities, volunteering slots, many leisure activities and classroom based training courses.\nGate Lodge is an old lodge situated at the entrance to Cathedral Walk, off the New Road in Killarney. It was offered by the Diocese of Kerry to Kerry Parents & Friends Association for use as a Day \/ Training Centre for people with intellectual disability. It is a beautifully renovated building, centrally located in Killarney town, next to Killarney’s National Park. One to one individual support is offered in the Gate Lodge and opportunities to access local amenities is encouraged.\nKerry Parents & Friends operates four community residences in and around Killarney Town. All of our houses are staffed seven days per week and those living there are supported to live their lives actively or quietly in their community, depending on their own preferences.\nCherry Lodge is a 5 bedroom, single storey bungalow situated 3km from Killarney town on Mill Road. It is very close to the Gleneagle Hotel and INEC Conference and Entertainment Centre which is easily accessible for shows and concerts. Three people currently live in the house and attend at the Old Monastery for their day service. They pursue their chosen leisure activities supported by two staff on duty at all times.\nHawthorn is a single storey bungalow 4km from Killarney town in Inchicullane, Kilcummin. It is home to two people who have subdivided the house into two living areas so that their personal space and privacy is maintained. They also get together for a chat and for meals if they so wish. Living as independently as possible is supported in Hawthorn and the residents decide their own activities each day.\nLohan Lodge is a single storey bungalow situated 8km from Killarney town.

{"content":"Hopefully, when authorities capture the person or people responsible, we'll learn a motive for Monday's Boston Marathon bombings.\nNo, we don't expect it to make sense.\nOnly a cowardly, cruel and thoroughly warped mind could hatch such a crime.\nStill, it's natural to ask \"Why?\" after an attack like this, to try to make some sense of it.\nAuthorities Wednesday said they have video of a man dropping a duffel bag containing the second homemade bomb and walking away. They haven't identified him yet, but we have no doubt they will.\nAs one official said after the attack, law enforcement officers are prepared to go to the ends of the earth to capture him.\nWe have to wonder if he thought he was making some kind of political statement or was trying to call attention to a perceived injustice.\nIn the end, though, it might be he just wanted to kill or maim as many people as possible.\nThat, of course, is what he'll be remembered for.\nWe seem to recall Timothy McVeigh believed he had some sort of justification for the Oklahoma City bombing in the 1990s.\nBut what we remember is a loser who killed more than 100 men, women and children, was captured, strapped to a table and put to death for his crime.\nMcVeigh's \"reasoning\" still lives somewhere on the Internet, but it's not worth the effort to search for it.\nAuthorities rightly have labeled the Boston bombings an act of terrorism.

They don't race toward an explosion -- as emergency workers, spectators and marathon participants alike did -- to help the victims.\nThey huddle inside in fear -- they don't open their homes and businesses to strangers affected by the emergency.\nOver and over this week we've heard residents say Boston was a \"strong\" city, and it won't be the same after this.\nIt will be stronger.\nLike the rest of the country, we pray for the victims -- those killed, maimed and their families.\nThe twin blasts destroyed lives and limbs, and the healing process will be long.\nThe city of Boston's spirit, however, appears unscathed by a so-far anonymous coward.","url":"http:\/\/www.yorkdispatch.com\/editorials\/ci_23052512\/websubscribe","timestamp":"2014-08-20 23:25:42","dump":"CC-MAIN-2014-35","segment":"1408500809686.31","md5":"1dd76fb59e85872d1318daca54f0c487","docid":"falcon_www.yorkdispatch.com_1dd76fb59e85872d1318daca54f0c487","rand":0.8567736673146613}
{"content":"Dick Van Dyke was born Richard Wayne Van Dyke in West Plains, Missouri, to Hazel Victoria (McCord), a stenographer, and Loren Wayne Van Dyke, a salesman. His younger brother is entertainer Jerry Van Dyke. His ancestry includes English, Scottish, German, Swiss-German, and Dutch. Although he'd had small roles beforehand, Van Dyke was launched to stardom in the 1960 musical \"Bye-Bye Birdie\", for which he won a Tony Award, and, then, later in the movie based on that play, Bye Bye Birdie (1963). He has starred in a number of films throughout the years including Mary Poppins (1964), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) and Fitzwilly (1967), as well as a number of successful television series which won him no less than four Emmys and three made-for-CBS movies. After separating from his wife, Margie Willett, in the 1970s, Dick later became involved with Michelle Triola. Margie and Dick had four children born during the first ten years of their marriage: Barry Van Dyke; Carrie Beth van Dyke; Christian Van Dyke and Stacy Van Dyke, all of whom are now in their forties and married themselves. He has seven grandchildren, including Shane Van Dyke, Carey Van Dyke, Wes Van Dyke and Taryn Van Dyke (Barry's children) and family members often appear with him on Diagnosis Murder (1993).  See full bio on IMDb »\nIn 1959, Van Dyke landed a small part in the Broadway comedy review Girls Against the Boys. The show only lasted two weeks, and he soon moved on to another production. Along with Chita Rivera, Paul Lynde and Charles Nelson Reilly, Van Dyke was cast in the musical Bye Bye Birdie, which made its Broadway debut in 1960. The musical proved to a big hit, and it brought Van Dyke his one and only Tony Award win in 1961, for his supporting role. Not long after, his career took off.\nVan Dyke began his film career by playing the role of Albert J. Peterson in the film version of Bye Bye Birdie (1963). Despite his unhappiness with the adaptation—its focus differed from the stage version in that the story now centered on a previously supporting character[32]—the film was a success. That same year, Van Dyke was cast in two roles: as the chimney sweep Bert, and as bank chairman Mr. Dawes Senior, in Walt Disney's Mary Poppins (1964). For his scenes as the chairman, he was heavily costumed to look much older and was credited in that role as \"Navckid Keyd\" (at the end of the credits, the letters unscramble into \"Dick Van Dyke\"). Van Dyke's attempt at a cockney accent has been lambasted as one of the worst accents in film history, cited by actors since as an example of how not to sound. In a 2003 poll by Empire magazine of the worst-ever accents in film, he came in second (to Sean Connery in The Untouchables, despite Connery winning an Academy Award for that performance).[33][34] According to Van Dyke, his accent coach was Irish, who \"didn't do an accent any better than I did\", and that no one alerted him to how bad it was during the production.[35][36][37] Still, Mary Poppins was successful on release and its appeal has endured. \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\", one of the songs that Van Dyke performed in Mary Poppins, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the Sherman Brothers, the film's songwriting duo.\nWhat particularly struck me when I saw the old Dutch paintings again is that they were usually painted quickly. That these great masters like Hals, Rembrandt, Ruisdael – so many others – as far as possible just put it straight down – and didn't come back to it so very much. And – this, too, please – that if it worked, they left it alone. Above all I admired hands by Rembrandt and Hals – hands that lived, but were not finished in the sense that people want to enforce nowadays ... In the winter I'm going to explore various things regarding manner that I noticed in the old paintings. I saw a great deal that I needed. But this above all things – what they call – dashing off – you see that's what the old Dutch painters did famously. That – dashing off – with a few brushstrokes, they won't hear of it now – but how true the results are.\nVan Dyke received a Grammy Award in 1964, along with Julie Andrews, for his performance on the soundtrack to Mary Poppins.[41] In 1970, he published Faith, Hope and Hilarity: A Child's Eye View of Religion a book of humorous anecdotes based largely on his experiences as a Sunday School teacher.[42] Van Dyke was principal in \"KXIV Inc.\" and owned 1400 AM KXIV in Phoenix (later KSUN) from 1965 to 1985.[citation needed]\nDick Van Dyke was born Richard Wayne Van Dyke in West Plains, Missouri, to Hazel Victoria (McCord), a stenographer, and Loren Wayne Van Dyke, a salesman.

He has seven grandchildren, including Shane Van Dyke, Carey Van Dyke, Wes Van Dyke and Taryn Van Dyke (Barry's children) and family members often appear with him on Diagnosis Murder (1993).\nBetween 1885 and his death in 1890, Van Gogh appears to have been building an oeuvre,[221] a collection that reflected his personal vision, and could be commercially successful. He was influenced by Blanc's definition of style, that a true painting required optimal use of colour, perspective and brushstrokes. Van Gogh applied the word \"purposeful\" to paintings he thought he had mastered, as opposed to those he thought of as studies.[222] He painted many series of studies;[218] most of which were still lifes, many executed as colour experiments or as gifts to friends.[223] The work in Arles contributed considerably to his oeuvre: those he thought the most important from that time were The Sower, Night Cafe, Memory of the Garden in Etten and Starry Night. With their broad brushstrokes, inventive perspectives, colours, contours and designs, these paintings represent the style he sought.[219]\nHis film work affected his TV career: the reviews he received for his role as D.A. Fletcher in Dick Tracy led him to star as the character Dr. Mark Sloan first in an episode of Jake and the Fatman, then in a series of TV movies on CBS that became the foundation for his popular television drama Diagnosis: Murder. The series ran from 1993 to 2001 with son Barry Van Dyke co-starring in the role of Dr. Sloan's son Lieutenant Detective Steve Sloan. Also starring on the same show was daytime soap actress Victoria Rowell as Dr. Sloan's pathologist\/medical partner, Dr. Amanda Bentley, and Charlie Schlatter in the role of Dr. Sloan's student, Dr. Jesse Travis.[29] Van Dyke continued to find television work after the show ended, including a dramatically and critically successful performance of The Gin Game, produced for television in 2003 that reunited him with Mary Tyler Moore. In 2003, he portrayed a doctor on Scrubs. A 2004 special of The Dick Van Dyke Show titled The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited was heavily promoted as the first new episode of the classic series to be shown in 38 years. Van Dyke and his surviving cast members recreated their roles; although nominated for a Primetime Emmy,[30][31][better source needed] the program was roundly panned by critics. In 2006 he guest-starred as college professor Dr. Jonathan Maxwell for a series of Murder 101 mystery films on the Hallmark Channel.\nIn these series, Van Gogh was not preoccupied by his usual interest in filling his paintings with subjectivity and emotion; rather the two series are intended to display his technical skill and working methods to Gauguin,[134] who was about to visit. The 1888 paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist. Vincent wrote to Theo in August 1888, \"I'm painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won't surprise you when it's a question of painting large sunflowers ... If I carry out this plan there'll be a dozen or so panels. The whole thing will therefore be a symphony in blue and yellow. I work on it all these mornings, from sunrise. Because the flowers wilt quickly and it's a matter of doing the whole thing in one go.\"[243]\nI was an alcoholic for about twenty-five years. In the Fifties and Sixties, everybody had their martini, everybody smoked incessantly. The funny thing is that all through my twenties and early thirties I didn't drink at all. Then we moved to a neighborhood full of young families with the same age kids and everyone drank heavily, there were big parties every night. I would go to work with terrible hangovers which if you're dancing is really hard. I was in deep trouble, you get suicidal and think you just can't go on. I had suicidal feelings, it was just terrible. But then suddenly, like a blessing, the drink started not to taste good. I would feel a little dizzy and a little nauseous and I wasn't getting the click. Today I wouldn't want a drink for anything. But I do occasionally think of taking a nice drag. I've been on this gum for ten years and it's just as addictive but at least it's not hurting my lungs. (2013)\nOn 7 May Van Gogh moved from the Hôtel Carrel to the Café de la Gare,[121] having befriended the proprietors, Joseph and Marie Ginoux. The Yellow House had to be furnished before he could fully move in, but he was able to use it as a studio.[122] He wanted a gallery to display his work, and started a series of paintings that eventually included Van Gogh's Chair (1888), Bedroom in Arles (1888), The Night Café (1888), Café Terrace at Night (September 1888), Starry Night Over the Rhone (1888), and Still Life: Vase with Twelve Sunflowers (1888), all intended for the decoration for the Yellow House.[123]\nAs an a cappella enthusiast, he has sung in a group called \"Dick Van Dyke and The Vantastix\" since September 2000. The quartet has performed several times in Los Angeles as well as on Larry King Live, The First Annual TV Land Awards, and sang the national anthem at three Los Angeles Lakers games including a nationally televised NBA Finals performance on NBC. Van Dyke was made an honorary member of the Barbershop Harmony Society in 1999.[43]\nIn April 1876 he returned to England to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small boarding school in Ramsgate. When the proprietor moved to Isleworth in Middlesex, Van Gogh went with him.[35][36] The arrangement did not work out and he left to become a Methodist minister's assistant.[37] His parents had meanwhile moved to Etten;[38] in 1876 he returned home at Christmas for six months and took work at a bookshop in Dordrecht. He was unhappy in the position and spent his time doodling or translating passages from the Bible into English, French and German.[39] He immersed himself in religion, and became increasingly pious and monastic.[40] According to his flatmate of the time, Paulus van Görlitz, Van Gogh ate frugally, avoiding meat.[41]\nMany of the late paintings are sombre but essentially optimistic and, right up to the time of Van Gogh's death, reflect his desire to return to lucid mental health. Yet some of his final works reflect his deepening concerns.[257][258] Writing in July 1890, from Auvers, Van Gogh said that he had become absorbed \"in the immense plain against the hills, boundless as the sea, delicate yellow\".[181]\nAlong that same vein, in August 2013, reports about a new health scare involving Van Dyke were circulating worldwide. According to reports, a sports car that Van Dyke was operating on L.A.'s 101 Freeway suddenly burst into flames on August 19, leaving the actor trapped inside the burning vehicle until a passing motorist who had witnessed the accident could come to his aid. Thanks to the passerby, Jason Pennington, Van Dyke left the scene of the accident unscathed—not only did the actor walk away uninjured and needing no medical treatment, he did not receive a citation for the incident, according to The Associated Press. According to some reports, Van Dyke had reported engine trouble with the vehicle the previous day, on August 18.\nThe portraits gave Van Gogh his best opportunity to earn. He believed they were \"the only thing in painting that moves me deeply and that gives me a sense of the infinite.\"[223][226] He wrote to his sister that he wished to paint portraits that would endure, and that he would use colour to capture their emotions and character rather than aiming for photographic realism.[227] Those closest to Van Gogh are mostly absent from his portraits; he rarely painted Theo, Van Rappard or Bernard. The portraits of his mother were from photographs.[228]\nI am extremely unhappy with the service I was provided. My wife and I just moved, and are on a tight budget. We were in need of a mattress due to having to leave the old one at our old place. After sleeping on an air mattress for a few months we decided it was time to bite the bullet and buy a real one. We went to art van and got a cheaper mattress (due to the tight budget) and told it was not in stock at their location but it was at their Dearborn location, and they would have it shuttled and we could pick it up in 1-2 business days. After they took our card information and charged us they informed us that the mattress wouldn't be ready until February, and we are now going to have to wait 3 weeks.\nThe self-portraits reflect an unusually high degree of self-scrutiny.[233] Often they were intended to mark important periods in his life, for example the mid-1887 Paris series were painted at the point where he became aware of Claude Monet, Paul Cezanne and Signac.[234] In Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat, heavy strains of paint spread outwards across the canvas. It is one of his most renowned self-portraits of that period, \"with its highly organized rhythmic brushstrokes, and the novel halo derived from the Neo-impressionist repertoire was what Van Gogh himself called a 'purposeful' canvas\".[235]\nVan Gogh made several painting excursions during visits to the landscape around Arles. He made paintings of harvests, wheat fields and other rural landmarks of the area, including The Old Mill (1888); a good example of a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond.[116] At various points, Van Gogh painted the view from his window – at The Hague, Antwerp, and Paris. These works culminated in The Wheat Field series, which depicted the view from his cells in the asylum at Saint-Rémy.[256]\nHis understanding of the possibilities of painting was evolving rapidly; from studying Hals he learned to portray the freshness of a visual impression, while the works of Paolo Veronese and Eugène Delacroix taught him that colour can express something by itself. This led to his enthusiasm for Peter Paul Rubens and inspired his sudden departure for Antwerp, Belgium, where the greatest number of Rubens’s works could be seen. The revelation of Rubens’s mode of direct notation and of his ability to express a mood by a combination of colours proved decisive in the development of van Gogh’s style. Simultaneously, van Gogh discovered Japanese prints and Impressionist painting. All these sources influenced him more than the academic principles taught at the Antwerp Academy, where he was enrolled. His refusal to follow the academy’s dictates led to disputes, and after three months he left precipitately in 1886 to join Theo in Paris. There, still concerned with improving his drawing, van Gogh met Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, and others who were to play historic roles in modern art. They opened his eyes to the latest developments in French painting. At the same time, Theo introduced him to Camille Pissarro, Georges Seurat, and other artists of the Impressionist group.\nVan Gogh entered the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum on 8 May 1889, accompanied by his carer, Frédéric Salles, a Protestant clergyman. Saint-Paul was a former monastery in Saint-Rémy, located less than 30 kilometres (19 mi) from Arles, and was run by a former naval doctor, Théophile Peyron. Van Gogh had two cells with barred windows, one of which he used as a studio.[162] The clinic and its garden became the main subjects of his paintings. He made several studies of the hospital's interiors, such as Vestibule of the Asylum and Saint-Rémy (September 1889). Some of his works from this time are characterised by swirls, such as The Starry Night. He was allowed short supervised walks, during which time he painted cypresses and olive trees, including Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background 1889, Cypresses 1889, Cornfield with Cypresses (1889), Country road in Provence by Night (1890). In September 1889 he produced two further versions of Bedroom in Arles.[163]\nThe most comprehensive primary source on Van Gogh is the correspondence between him and his younger brother, Theo. Their lifelong friendship, and most of what is known of Vincent's thoughts and theories of art, are recorded in the hundreds of letters they exchanged from 1872 until 1890.[7] Theo van Gogh was an art dealer and provided his brother with financial and emotional support, and access to influential people on the contemporary art scene.[8]\nIn all the company has nearly 200 stores.[17] Art Van had partnered with Paul's TV to open a section for Paul's TV to sell televisions inside Art Van stores. 18 locations were opened, however all were closed down by 2015.[18] Other boutique sections have included AV Flooring, and Art Van Furniture also operates three Scott Shuptrine interior design studios in the state of Michigan.[19] Art Van also produces a mail catalog of its furniture designs.[20]\nGogh, Vincent van: Bouquet of Flowers in a VaseBouquet of Flowers in a Vase, oil on canvas by Vincent van Gogh, c. 1889–90; in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. 65.1 × 54 cm.Photograph by Trevor Little.

Annenberg, 2002 (1993.400.4)\nVan Gogh’s fame dates from the early years of the 20th century, and since then his reputation has never ceased to grow. A large part of this reputation is based on the image of van Gogh as a struggling genius, working unappreciated in isolation. The dramatic elements of his life—poverty, self-mutilation, mental breakdown, and suicide—feed the drama of this mythology. The notion that his unorthodox talent was unrecognized and rejected by society heightens the legend, as it is just that sort of isolation and struggle that has come to define the modern concept of the artist. This mythical van Gogh has become almost inseparable from his art, inspiring artists to dramatize his saga in poems, novels, films, operas, dance ensembles, orchestral compositions, and a popular song. Wide and diverse audiences have come to appreciate his art, and the record-breaking attendance at exhibitions of his works—as well as the popularity of commercial items featuring imagery from his oeuvre—reveal that, within the span of a century, van Gogh has become perhaps the most recognized painter of all time. The unprecedented prices his works have attained through auction and the attention paid to forgery scandals have only increased van Gogh’s stature in the public imagination.\nVan Gogh learned about Fernand Cormon's atelier from Theo.[107] He worked at the studio in April and May 1886,[108] where he frequented the circle of the Australian artist John Peter Russell, who painted his portrait in 1886.[109] Van Gogh also met fellow students Émile Bernard, Louis Anquetin and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec – who painted a portrait of him in pastel. They met at Julien \"Père\" Tanguy's paint shop,[108] (which was, at that time, the only place where Paul Cézanne's paintings were displayed). In 1886, two large exhibitions were staged there, showing Pointillism and Neo-impressionism for the first time, and bringing attention to Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. Theo kept a stock of Impressionist paintings in his gallery on boulevard Montmartre, but Van Gogh was slow to acknowledge the new developments in art.[110]\nVincent van Gogh wrote over 800 letters in his lifetime to family and friends the majority of which were to his beloved brother Theo Van Gogh. The letters provide insight to the life of the artist as well as his work. They allow us to know more about his life, how he thought and how he worked than nearly any other artist. In the Letters section, you can learn more about the significance of Vincent van Gogh's letters and find a link to a resource containing Van Gogh's translated letters.\nIn 1942, Van Dyke enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, and ended up in the special services unit. There, he performed in shows and hosted a radio show. After being discharged from the service in 1945, Van Dyke tried his hand at advertising, but after realizing that the business wasn't a good match for him, he joined novelty lip-synching act the \"Merry Mutes\" and moved to California.\nThose of you who have followed this saga and supported my efforts with your countless emails will understand when I say that regardless of money, ethics, William Morris Agents and their lawyers, and anyone else who has the guts to call this project their own, I can honestly say that I am sitting here in my apartment in New York City SMILING BIG SMILES because I know in my heart (and so does EVERYONE ELSE) that this whole bloody thing...and all of your happiness....was because of something I did.\nAfter much pleading from Van Gogh, Gauguin arrived in Arles on 23 October, and in November the two painted together. Gauguin depicted Van Gogh in his The Painter of Sunflowers; Van Gogh painted pictures from memory, following Gauguin's suggestion. Among these \"imaginative\" paintings is Memory of the Garden at Etten.[132][note 8] Their first joint outdoor venture was at the Alyscamps, when they produced the pendants Les Alyscamps.[133] The single painting Gauguin completed during his visit was Van Gogh Painting Sunflowers.[134]\nWe had a little ranch way out in the middle of nowhere. My wife didn't like showbusiness - as most spouses don't: they get shunted aside. But it was too soon for me. I could not afford either emotionally or financially to quit and retire. Not in my forties. We finally parted company because of that. And now another forty years have gone by and I've been very busy. I still am.\nVan Dyke left high school in 1944, his senior year, intending to join the United States Army Air Forces for pilot training during World War II. Denied enlistment several times for being underweight, he was eventually accepted for service as a radio announcer before transferring to the Special Services and entertaining troops in the continental United States.[11] He received his high school diploma in 2004 at the age of 78.[12]\nVincent Willem van Gogh (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsɛnt ˈʋɪləm vɑŋ ˈɣɔx] (listen);[note 1] 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. However, he was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty.\nMattresses, Bedroom Sets and Headboards - You will rest well with a Tempur-Pedic, Stearns & Foster, or PureSleep queen or king mattress set that fits your sleep style.

She had previously borne two children who died, but Van Gogh was unaware of this;[74] on 2 July, she gave birth to a baby boy, Willem.[75] When Van Gogh's father discovered the details of their relationship, he put pressure on his son to abandon Sien and her two children. Vincent at first defied him,[76] and considered moving the family out of the city, but in late 1883, he left Sien and the children.[77]\nTheo kept all of Vincent's letters to him;[10] Vincent kept few of the letters he received. After both had died, Theo's widow Johanna arranged for the publication of some of their letters. A few appeared in 1906 and 1913; the majority were published in 1914.[11][12] Vincent's letters are eloquent and expressive and have been described as having a \"diary-like intimacy\",[8] and read in parts like autobiography.[8] The translator Arnold Pomerans wrote that their publication adds a \"fresh dimension to the understanding of Van Gogh's artistic achievement, an understanding granted us by virtually no other painter\".[13]\nIn December 1888 he painted La Berceuse – a figure that he thought as good as his sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours.[219] It appears to be a culmination of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.[229]\nVan Dyke made headlines again in April 2013, this time for an incident of a much different kind—one posing a threat to the actor's life, not celebrating it the way the prestigious event had just weeks earlier. The legendary performer announced that he was suffering from an \"undiagnosed neurological disorder,\" posting on his Twitter page: \"My head bangs every time I lay down. I've had every test come back that I'm perfectly healthy. Anybody got any ideas?\" The famed TV personality was reportedly advised by his doctor to avoid plane travel and rest until further tests could be conducted to pinpoint the direct cause of his head pain.\n[about Mary Poppins (1964)] I thought Walt Disney hired me because I was such a great singer and dancer.

{"content":"However much they might detest Trump , suburbanites are not likely to rally long-term to a party that seeks to wipe out their way of life. The assault on suburbia, both from the ultra-capitalist right and socialist-minded left, neglects the very reasons—space and privacy—people of all ethnicities move to suburbia. Just as Republicans can ignore the unintended consequences of ultra-free market policies, Democrats ignore the aspirations of their own voters.\nMore important still, the anti-single-family campaign undermines the foundation of our democracy. The essence of American civilization has been the pursuit of a better life for oneself and one’s family. Take away the ability to own one’s home and we are well on our road to a neo-feudal society where the masses will need to rely on the state not only for housing but, without meaningful assets, to finance their retirement.\nThe clamor to restrict single-family homes and thus push the American dream further out of many Americans’ reach, represents an assault on what both parties once espoused. An America without widespread homeownership is no longer an aspirational country, but a place where people remain imprisoned by their class and unable to pursue what they perceive as a better quality of life.\nThe suburbs are the way they are because the American people wanted to live in suburbia. Both political parties supported this mission for much of the 20th century through monies and programs.\nUnless Democrats and Republicans cater to suburban voters, they will have a difficult future as political parties.\nBut, this seems to assume that this suburban way of life based around a home and emphasis on family will always continue this way. To some degree, Americans did desire land and privacy from the beginning yet the suburban experience was really made available to the masses first around the turn of the twentieth century and then even more so after World War II. Younger or future Americans could decide they would prefer cities and denser areas or even rural areas and the political parties could help lead them in that direction.\nAll that to say, I think Kotkin is right in that a majority of Americans continue to profess interest in living in suburbia. At the same time, this could change in the future and one or both of the political parties could start leading in that direction. Not all Americans want to be suburbanites so there is political room to suggest alternatives.\nMedia discourse about political parties as well as the public pronouncements of politicians tend to reify that certain policy positions are fixed between the two political parties. “Republicans always want to help the wealthy with their tax cuts.” “Democrats always fight for non-white residents.” And so on.\nYet, political parties change positions fairly regularly and often do so for political, rather than ideological, considerations. Here are two examples I found while reading American Sociology: From Pre-Disciplinary to Post-Normal by Stephen Turner.\nIt might be easy to write this off as being in the past – anything past even just a few years ago is very difficult to discuss in media settings – but these two examples provide a reminder that political parties can indeed change dramatically. What Democrats and Republicans look like today is not the same as they were decades ago nor will they necessarily be the same ten or twenty years from now.\nIn part seen as a referendum on President Trump, Ossoff’s out-of-the-blue campaign also offers a mirror on how changing suburban values are coming to a head in unexpected ways.\nThe new suburban appeal resonates not just for younger Americans in search of authentic experiences, but older ones as well, ranging from empty nesters who want a more urban lifestyle without having to move to the city to Gen X divorcees who are trying to juggle jobs, social lives, and two households without being stuck in Atlanta traffic all day.\nI’ll add a bit more since this touches on one areas of my research: from the outside, suburbs may look all the same. The physical pieces may be similar (different configurations of subdivisions, roads, big box stores and fast food establishments, etc.) and there are presumed to be similar values (middle-class homeowners who fiercely protect local interests such as property values). Yet, if you spend time in suburban areas, you find that communities can differ quite a bit even if they all fit under the umbrella term “suburb.” Depending on the demographics of particular communities (and suburbs are increasingly non-white as well as have more poor residents) as well as unique histories (which are influenced by the date of founding, distance from the big city, and actions of past and current leaders), suburbs can be quite different and have their own character.\nSo trying to understand voting patterns in suburbs can be complicated. Suburbs closer to big cities tend to lean Democratic and those at the metropolitan edges lean Republican. In the middle, voters can be swayed and are less predictable – indeed, they may be the real swing states for politicians to fight over. This map of the primary results in the New York Times supports these earlier findings: there are different clusters of support for the various candidates throughout the suburban district.\nAs the former mayor of Richmond, Kaine is the first (relatively) big-city mayor on either party’s national ticket since Democrats nominated Hubert Humphrey, the mayor of Minneapolis in the 1940s, as their presidential candidate in 1968.\nRecent presidential cycles have had Democrats solidly winning cities, Republicans solidly winning rural areas, and the two parties fighting over suburban voters (Republicans winning the exurbs, Democrats winning inner-ring suburbs). Both their efforts thus far – Trump on law and order and Clinton on making the country fairer for the working and middle class – could be viewed as efforts to appeal to these middle suburbanites. What exactly do suburbanites want these days from candidates? Good jobs and schools? Safety? Access to the American Dream? The outcome of this election may just hinge on who is best able to move beyond their reliable geographic bases and court suburbanites.\nThe biggest urban problem is that all the major American cities are run by Democrats?\nThe rapid growth of urban areas, increased population density, and a massive influx of immigrants—accompanying the explosion of manufacturing and commerce during the Gilded Age—hastened the rise of municipal political machines (such as Tammany Hall in New York City), official corruption, labor unrest, and the demographic diversity that continues to this day. Even though Americans’ standard of living generally improved during industrialization (people moved to the cities for a reason), the Progressive movement was in significant part a response to America’s nascent urban problems.\nProgressivism is a legacy that endures, as we know, and for good or ill, urbanization has profoundly affected the American experience. Members of ethnic minorities disproportionately reside in U.S. cities, and their local governments are disproportionately (in fact more or less exclusively) in the hands of the Democratic Party. Cities expend substantial taxpayer resources to try to address poverty, crime, air pollution, congestion, substandard housing, homelessness, and the education of non-English speaking students, all of which are not as prevalent in suburban and rural areas.\nCities present different challenges than they did a century ago, but the current problems are no less dire. Costly and ineffective public education systems, massively under-funded public employee pension plans, law-enforcement failures, high taxes, and uncontrolled spending imperil the security and solvency of America’s cities. Unless these problems are promptly addressed by responsible state reforms, more urban residents will face the tragic plight of Detroit, Chicago, Baltimore, and San Bernardino.\nIt would be interesting to see a recent example where more conservative policies helped a large city. Perhaps it is simply hard to find a case from today with most big cities having Democrat mayors. Is the historical record kinder? I recently read about “Big Bill” Thompson who was the last Republican mayor of Chicago, leaving office in 1931. He had all sorts of problems and Wikipedia sums up: “He ranks among the most unethical mayors in American history.” Maybe we could look to Rudy Giuliani in New York City who is often credited for helping reduce crime in the city (due to applying broken windows theory) and for strong leadership after the September 11th attacks. But, some of his legacy has been questioned as crime rates dropped in numerous other major cities and such policies may have come at a cost. All together, it is easy for one party to blame the other but why not have a discussion of exactly how Republicans have actually helped cities in recent years?\nCities are complex places which is why they started drawing so much attention from social scientists and others in the 1800s. Having a change in political party of leadership won’t automatically solve issues: how do we tackle neighborhoods that have now been poor for several generations? How about income inequality? Development and economic opportunities throughout big cities and not just in wealthy areas? The presence and activity of gangs? Providing affordable housing? Avoiding police brutality? Maintaining and upgrading critical infrastructure? Again, it is easy to blame one party but these are not easy issues to address – there is a level of complexity that would prove difficult for a mayor of any party.\n2. The house was built by GTM Architects, and decorated by DC interior designer Skip Sroka, who is known for his methods for hiding electronic appliances (so as to not detract from faux-Old European flourishes). He spent three years decorating this “American palace,” as he called it in the Washington Post.\n1. This is definitely a mansion, not a McMansion. Given the costs, 40,000 square feet, and the extra features, this is beyond normal McMansion territory. Indeed, I suspect a normal McMansion would definitely not be up to par for hosting important politicians.\n2. I thought McMansions were for conservatives? The headline may be playing around with these stereotypes by suggesting that Democrats with money also live in and visit such homes. Going further, I would guess the homes of wealthy Republicans and Democrats may not differ all that much.\nApparently, this is a strategy common to both political parties: when the poll numbers aren’t in your favor on the national stage, argue that the numbers are flawed.\nThe [Democratic] party is stoking skepticism in the final stretch of the midterm campaign, providing a mirror image of conservative complaints in 2012 about “skewed” polls in the presidential race between President Obama and Republican Mitt Romney.\nDemocrats who do not want their party faithful to lose hope — particularly in a midterm election that will be largely decided on voter turnout — are taking aim at the pollsters, arguing that they are underestimating the party’s chances in November.\nThis year, Democrats have been upset with Silver’s predictions that Republicans are likely to retake the Senate. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) mocked Silver at a fundraising luncheon in Seattle that was also addressed by Vice President Biden, according to a White House pool report on Thursday.\nThere are lots of good questions to ask about political polls, including looking at their sampling, the questions they ask, and how they make their projections. Yet, that doesn’t automatically mean that everything has been manipulated to lead to a certain outcome.\nOne way around this? Try to aggregate among various polls and projections. RealClearPolitics has a variety of polls in many races for the 2014 elections. Aggregation also helps get around the issue of celebrity where people like Nate Silver build careers on being right – until they are wrong.\nAt the most basic level, the argument about flawed polls is probably about turning out the base to vote. If some people won’t vote because they think their vote won’t overturn the majority, then you have to find ways to convince them that their vote still matters.","md5":"9a0b95c03437dd32502046106a66d94d","docid":"redpajama_c4_9a0b95c03437dd32502046106a66d94d","rand":0.8567736741733832}

Need the armchair at the indie bookstore to be by the window? Move it. Need a hot water kettle for your coffee? Buy one. Want to sit on the dorm patio to watch the vivacious, vicious thunderstorm? Roll in a chair from a vacant dorm room. — I hadn’t realized this was a habit, or quality, of myself until another teacher in my month-long PD in Amherst pointed it out as I poured hot water over a travel cone of local coffee into a newly purchased giant mug. He reflected that I do this: I arrange things how I need them. Cool!\n- I am susceptible to the black-hole vacuum of others’ needs. I have tools to ground myself (going for walks, to meetings, envisioning a tree), but my marrow setting is to allow my attention, my whole interior monologue, to be consumed and overwritten by your moment-to-moment needs. This is not entirely new information, but it shed brighter light on my relationship patterns and gave me compassionate perspective on how I grew up and how these patterns formed. Which will in turn, one hopes, help me repair that gulf between me and myself in challenging circumstances.\n- I love where I live so much it brought tears when I finally sat this morning with my (giant) mug at my kitchen table and no pants. (Privacy, you are a gift!!) All here is “arranged” as I need, and I am beyond grateful for a warm place to call home in a neighborhood that provides what I need just a walk away.\nThere will be more to learn and grow from as I readjust to my life here (the least of which is the time zone!). But as I settle in, I know that what I’ve learned of myself is one of the truest gifts of my travel.\nWelcome back, readers.","md5":"efcac2d380607d5542452c845562d082","docid":"ccwarc_owningvoice.com_efcac2d380607d5542452c845562d082","rand":0.856773674993011}
{"content":"One Cass County Deputy Sheriff and a Missouri State Highway Patrol Trooper received serious injuries after being assaulted by a subject suspected of being under the influence of narcotics early Sunday morning.\nAround 1:00 am Sunday Cass County Deputies were dispatched to the area 3rd St. and Fir St. in Garden City, MO. after receiving calls that a male subject had damaged a vehicle and broken windows of a house. A Cass County Deputy arrived on the scene and located the subject covered in a large amount of blood standing near a street sign. Two Missouri State Highway Patrol Troopers and a second Cass County Deputy arrived on the scene and attempted to speak with the subject. Friends of the subject at the scene stated that the subject was under the influence of an unknown substance and that they were unable to get him to cooperate and go home.\nOfficers gave commands to the subject, identified as Jesse D. A. Hodges, 19, Garden City, in an attempt to take him into custody. Mr. Hodges then charged and swung his fist in an attempt to punch one of the troopers. A deputy and trooper deployed tasers which had little or no effect on Mr. Hodges. Mr. Hodges continued to fight with all four law enforcement officers until he was able to be handcuffed.\nA Cass County Deputy was treated at an area hospital for a broken finger. A Missouri State Highway Patrol Trooper was admitted to an area hospital with serious injuries. Hodges was transported by ambulance to an area hospital for his injuries where he was treated and released to the Cass County Jail.\nJesse D.A. Hodges, 19, was charged with First Degree Assault on Law Enforcement Officer, Fourth Degree Assault on Law Enforcement Officer, 2 Counts Second Degree Property Damage. He is being held on a $250,000 Cash Only Bond.\nThe above arrest is a mere accusation and is not evidence of guilt. Evidence in support of these charges must be presented before a court of competent jurisdiction whose duty is to determine guilt or innocence.","md5":"fd3c83023c99877db4a843714a33db4a","docid":"redpajama_c4_fd3c83023c99877db4a843714a33db4a","rand":0.8567736761208413}

ACS 5-year estimate includes data collected over a 60-month period. The date of the data is the end of the 5-year period. For example, a value dated 2014 represents data from 2010 to 2014. However, they do not describe any specific day, month, or year within that time period.\nMultiyear estimates require some considerations that single-year estimates do not. For example, multiyear estimates released in consecutive years consist mostly of overlapping years and shared data. The 2010-2014 ACS 5-year estimates share sample data from 2011 through 2014 with the 2011-2015 ACS 5-year estimates. Because of this overlap, users should use extreme caution in making comparisons with consecutive years of multiyear estimates.\nPlease see \"Section 3: Understanding and Using ACS Single-Year and Multiyear Estimates\" on publication page 13 (file page 19) of the 2018 ACS General Handbook for a more thorough clarification.\nU.S. Census Bureau, Single-Parent Households with Children as a Percentage of Households with Children (5-year estimate) in Boone County, WV [S1101SPHOUSE054005], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/S1101SPHOUSE054005, January 28, 2023.\nSingle Parent Households with Children\nSingle-parent Households with Children as a Percentage of Households with Children, Annual: West Virginia\nGross Domestic Product: Private Services-Providing Industries in Boone County, WV\nSingle-Parent Households with Children as a Percentage of Households with Children (5-year estimate) in Boone County, WV\nBoone County, WV Counties West Virginia States U.S. Regional Data\nMore Series from Single Parent Households with Children\nBoone County, WV Charleston Single-parent West Virginia 5-Year Households Prosperity Scorecard County or County Equivalent Census Annual Not Seasonally Adjusted Public Domain: Citation Requested United States of America","md5":"8b536059178caddb1c7956df9fa8e356","docid":"redpajama_common-crawl_8b536059178caddb1c7956df9fa8e356","rand":0.856773677205678}

I'm just putting it here so that I'll force myself to work on it later.\nWhen the people of Earth first colonized another planet in the year 2100, they realized that they had finally reached the goal they had been striving for since creation; the stars. For the next 200 years, humanity lived in celebration and peace. Life was discovered under the surface of Mars in the form of microscopicity and harmlessness, Faster Than Light travel was discovered; Teleportation, basic terraforming became possible, and immortality was now a reality with cloning.\nHowever, in the year 2332, everything changed. As humanity continued to spread and grow, it discovered that the universe wasn't as simple and comfortable as was thought. The Humans discovered an alien life form with only one intent and purpose: to destroy all other life.\nThis being, now known as \"The God of Death\" or \"Nibiru,\" has the form of a human, except it is surrounded by a Jupiter-sized mass of glowing, semitransparent, orange fluid. The scientists of humanity have concluded that this fluid is the blood, bone, and flesh of millions of different forms of life broken down into liquid form. These same scientists have also concluded that Nibiru is so immensely powerful, that it is unbeatable.\nAny living thing that comes within a thousand miles of the being begins to suffer from severe stress, hallucinations, blindness, and, most importantly, they lose control over their own bodies. When this happens, Nibiru takes over.\nMany weapons have been launched at The God of Death, but none have made any impact. Anything that hits the fluid is simply absorbed then broken down. Explosions only create energy for the alien to feed off of.\nAfter four years of constant assault by Nibiru, the loss of hundreds of cities, and the destruction of Earth, humanity struck a deal with The God of Death. They offered never ending sacrifices in exchange for the promised safety of civilization. Death agreed.\nAnd so, in 2336, the rulers of humanity\nThe year is 2101. After nearly 70 years of constant war, the face of Earth has changed dramatically. Entire continents no longer exist or are radioactive wastelands due to nuclear war. Aside from refugees and small city states, only three \"real\" powers remain: the US, the UK, and Japan. Though, the areas they control are much different than what you may think.\n[MAP AND TERRITORY CHANGES]\nThe northern half of North America (start from Nebraska) is now a wasteland. There is nothing alive there anymore. Just being within 20 miles of the 'border' is enough to give you radiation poisoning. The US now occupies the southern half of North America, all of South America, and South Africa (and (technically) it's surrounding countries).\nRussia is no longer a part of the map. Instead there is just ocean and small, spread out islands too dangerous to get close to. The UK controls most of Africa and all of Europe (excluding: Estonia, Latvia, Belarus, Ukraine, Finland, and part of Sweden due to radiation).\nJapan controls all of Asia (excluding: Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and the Northwestern tip of China.)\nGood or Evil... ...It doesn't matter. You do what you're told, or you die.\nIn this game you play as a prisoner to a sadistic man you know only as \"The Steel.\" You and 6 other people must participate in his game where, each of you, must try to kill the others.

Research shows that effective school leaders focus on practices that will have a positive impact on learning for teachers and students. This Ruia website promotes practices that are proven to work across a range of contexts. School leaders can use it to fine-tune their appraisal practices in ways that lead to improved outcomes for Māori students.\nBecause effective appraisal interrogates the relationship between teachers’ actions and their students’ learning, parts of this website are also for teachers. By using this site, teachers will have more sense of ownership of the appraisal process as it contributes to cycles of professional learning that lead to improved outcomes for Māori students.\nBoards of trustees are responsible for developing appraisal policies and monitoring their implementation. Boards can use this website to gain an understanding of how appraisal can lift learning for both teachers and students.\nThe Ruia websites are a response to the persistent statistics showing that not enough Māori students are getting the opportunities they need to achieve educational success and participate confidently and actively in the world beyond. Educators in all parts of the system share the responsibility for addressing this issue as a matter of urgency. Ruia has a direct and serious focus on improving outcomes for Māori students.\nRuia is also a response to messages from policy and research. The Ministry of Education’s policy for Māori students is described in Ka Hikitia. Ka Hikitia’s strategic intent is for Māori to enjoy and achieve education success as Māori. This means having an education system that provides all Māori learners with the opportunity to get what they require to realise their own unique potential and succeed in their lives as Māori.\nreview and improvement of that practice.\ncontinuously improve their practice and understand what their next steps should be.\nBoth Ruia websites are organised around an inquiry and knowledge-building cycle. Users will take an inquiry approach, working through a planned cycle of inquiry focused on an issue that has been identified as a priority for furthering Māori student achievement.\nAn inquiry approach means that users look for evidence and question their assumptions. They reflect on what it is that they do and do not know. This process is a personal matter. Individuals have to reflect on themselves and on the impact of their words and actions on others. The process also involves inquiring alongside others who share the same interests and concerns.\nResearch shows that there are many missed opportunities to improve learning through teacher appraisal. However, many schools do use appraisal as an integral part of their professional learning, directly informed by student progress and the outcomes that are valued by the community.\nA common feature of these schools is that they are committed to self-review and inquiry. Teachers and in-school leaders are prepared to be vulnerable and to question their own beliefs and assumptions. They learn from their peers and their community, and they respond to what they learn.\nThis Ruia website draws on the experience of schools that have developed successful appraisal-for-learning practices. The case studies show examples of what these schools are doing to align teacher appraisal with professional learning to improve educational outcomes for their Māori students.\nProject leader: Simon Chiaroni (Learning Media).\nthe development of educationally powerful partnerships with parents and whānau.\nThe reference group started by looking at what has been shown to work in making a difference to Māori student achievement. The group wanted to know more about what was going on in schools in which Māori students were achieving success. Two members of the group went out into schools and interviewed school leaders, teachers, and parents. This experience, often profoundly moving, added considerably to the reference group’s understandings about effective school–whānau relationships and teacher appraisal. The group would like to acknowledge the contribution of these wise and passionate parents, teachers, and leaders to the creation of these websites.\nThe group’s next task was to draw together the evidence from research and the Ruia reference group’s own inquiry to shape up these websites. The challenge was to create new resources that would achieve their purpose, would not duplicate others, and would align with schools’ existing processes and practices. The group went to the literature about ‘smart tools’ to ensure that the two new websites would meet those criteria. An initial draft was then refined over time through iterative feedback from the reference group and through evaluation by a group of school leaders.","md5":"f1fc792a96e50a8f119a63579ece51c0","docid":"redpajama_c4_f1fc792a96e50a8f119a63579ece51c0","rand":0.8567736859642173}

{"content":"Biodiversity refers to the rate at which the living organisms are widespread on the earth; this is in a way that the living organisms both plants and animals are distributed and also the way other external factors affect their distribution all over the earth. The distribution of plants on the earth is affected by the climatic changes that keep on changing now and then; this has posted a great threat to most of the indigenous and natural state of our plants more so when it comes to the state of the forest. The survival of the natural forest is much affected by the changes in climate and other factors that pose a threat to the forest. In this paper, I will discuss the distribution of natural forest in the world and also the changes in the climate that affect the survival of natural forest in the world, also, will be able to talk about the causes of climatic change in the world.\nThe natural forest that is in the world are those that grew by themselves without being planted or being planned for they ‘just come into existence on their own, this has been effected by the favorable climatic conditions thus the forest striving best, on the other hand, the climate has been changing rapidly and this has had adverse effects on the woods thus making the forests to either fade away thus raising the alarm and leading to the rise of planted forests which now clear the natural ones, I am going to discuss all the climatic changes and the effects on the distribution of the natural forest in the world (Gradstein, Homeier, & Gansert, 2010).\nNatural forests are those forests that were not planted by man but the one that just grew themselves without any control or being monitored by any person. The distribution and survival of the forests have been a keen factor that is being observed and controlled since the natural forests are a habitat for most of the wild animals that also are faced with extinction when their natural habitat is being invaded or destroyed by the change in climate that also are the causes of human activities. The distribution of natural forest is reducing significantly and now to the extent that the natural forests are concentrated on the tropics that is the Tropic of Capricorn, Equator and the tropic of cancer. This is because the climate around this region is in a way favorable and tries to maintain the standards that favor the natural forests as said by (Gradstein, Homeier, & Gansert, 2010).\nThis distribution is at all cost determined by the rapid climatic changes that are unpredictable and also the keep changing to the worst on each day (Lovejoy, & Hannah, 2005). This has caused the natural forests to be faced out in other areas because they are unable to cope up with the harsh climate in those regions, in areas that are faced with drought and there is little or at times no rain will at no point be in the position to support the natural forest since there will be lack of water for the trees, on the other hand taking the type of climate that is favorable in the sense that there is adequate rain and the soils are favorable too, (Laurie, (2015) this comes in when the area is in a way affected by more of the industrial chemicals that will make the ozone layer in that area unfavorable and so this results to acid rain that instead of now being used by the trees for water the acid rain instead corrodes the trees and thus killing them and so making it unfit for the trees to survive in such areas and so this makes the place unfavorable for the forests to thrive (Perera, Buse, & Weber, 2004).\nThe climate around the world is not constant and the same in a way that, different regions have different types of climate, and it is only the individuals in that specific region who will be in the position to affect the change that is in the case of (Zachos, & Habel, 2011). The areas that have the natural rain forest are in a way having a favorable climate that will be able to support a planted forest, this climate will always not be well distributed in all the regions but just in a few selected regions of the world and so this makes the region favorable for the support of the natural forest, the climate at this areas will always be conserved so as not to destroy the already existing natural forests.\nThe change in climate is a gradual process that takes place in a series of years, and this can take place in a series of years following a series of exposure of harmful and adverse effects that will temper up with the climate (Leveque, & Mounolou.2003). One of the biggest problems that pose great threat to the changing of the climate is the depletion of the ozone layer, this layer protects the earth from the harmful rays of the sun, but because of the harmful gases that are emitted into the atmosphere from the earth by human activities, this gases corrode the ozone layer thus exposing the earth to this harmful rays and so this automatically changes the climatic sequence of the earth and this also will now lead to a sequence that is changed by the already existing living organisms more so the natural plants and forests thus posing a threat to the survival of the natural forests and their distribution on the earth (Laar, & Akca, 2007).\nIn conclusion, the climatic changes that take place in the world always have an adverse effect on the distribution of the natural forest, this is in a sense that when the change always occurs it will have a negative impact on the survival of the natural forest thus making them to only survive in one specific region that will at one point have the good climate that will support them (Chapman, & Roberts, 1997). These changes will always be followed by destruction and the lowering the percentage of the earth surface that is covered by the natural forests.\nBlaser, J., Carter, J. & Gilmour, D. (1998).

This is something you probably remember reading in the fall of 2016. If you’re looking for a mortgage you may be wondering how the new rules will affect you. We always recommend you speak with a licensed Mortgage Broker in Sylvan Lake. A qualified mortgage broker can assess your situation with no fee or obligation.\nWhenever you are purchasing a home in Canada with less then 20% down payment, mortgage default insurance is required. This is a requirement by all lenders and is actually regulated federally. This insurance policy is paid for by the borrower but is for the benefit of the lender. In the event you default on your mortgage loan, this insurance policy pays the lender back for the loan that was lent to you. This reduces the risk to the lender allowing them to lend up to 95% of the purchase price on your home. Thus, making home ownership much more attainable for Canadians.\nWith these new rule changes, mortgages which requires this mortgage default insurance (less then 20% down payment) must undergo a stress test. Whereby they determine if you can still afford your house if rates were to rise. The stress test means you have to qualify at the bank of Canada’s benchmark rate of 4.64% instead of the banks contract rate (actual rate) of around 2.79%.\nMany mortgage lenders with borrowers putting 20% or more for a down payment still choose to add a mortgage default insurance policy. This is to reduce their lending risk. However with 20% or more down payment these lenders typically pay the premium fees. This is how many monoline (mortgage only) lenders are able to provide lower rates to consumers then their bank counterparts. As their mortgages are “back end” insured with a lower risk to the investors.\nHowever further changes were announced as of Nov 30th 2016. New criteria for low-ratio or “back end” mortgage insurance took effect. These mortgages that are insured even with 20% down require the stress test. For many Canadians in this group, the changes will have little to no impact. They will still be able to enjoy low mortgage rates. For others it may reduce their options when it comes to mortgage refinances, renewals or purchases to stick with a bank lender not using mortgage insurance so the qualifying on the file still occurs at the contract rate. A mortgage broker has access to both bank and monoline lenders even more reason to contact for a review of your situation and any impact it may have.\nBeginning this tax year, these changes will also have significant tax implications. All home sales must be reported to the Canada Revenue Agency. Capital gains from sales of primary residences will remain tax-free. Although, the government is aiming to block foreign buyers from purchasing and selling homes, falsely claimed as primary residences to avoid capital gains tax.\nIf you’re looking for a mortgage in Sylvan Lake, our mortgage brokers have helped many people with their mortgage needs.

Your body needs time to digest what you have eaten. Consider spacing your meals at least 4-5 hours apart. The NY Times published an informative article on this subject: https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/10\/26\/opinion\/sunday\/the-dangers-of-eating-late-at-night.html.\nOne serving – avoid going back for “seconds.” Smaller portions are key.\nMake healthy choices – you’ll hear the phrase “healthy food costs more”. This can be true, but you can gradually introduce healthy foods and replace the unhealthy ones.\nHow much bread do you eat daily? More than you think.\nReduce your consumption of red meat – Try to avoid eating multiple types (ground beef, hamburgers, steak) in a 7-day time frame.\nEat lean meats – this includes thin chicken breasts. Like seafood? Try substituting fish once a week.\nConsider alternatives – turkey rather than beef. If you must buy ground beef, opt for the 93% offering; it costs approximately $3-$4 more than the 80% item. The decrease in fat content does make a difference. Soy, veggie and Tofu burgers have come a long way as well.\nChips, cookies, pastries and the like – cheat foods; occasional consumption is ok, but like everything, balance is key.\nCarbonated drinks (soda)– Eliminating soda is one of the most beneficial choices one can make. If you must drink soda, choose diet and avoid the darker drinks. Seltzer is a great alternative.\nDrink water – it sounds obvious, but it’s often taken for granted. A good habit is to consume 16oz of water as soon as you wake up. Keep a bottle of water by your bedside. This article speaks to the benefits of early-am water: http:\/\/alifeofproductivity.com\/killer-morning-habit-drink-water-right-after-you-wake-up\/.\nVegetables – yes, you need to eat them.

Everything that happens in an organism—its growth, its interaction with the environment, its reproduction, and even its movement—is based on chemical reactions.\n3\nChemical Reactions What happens to chemical bonds during chemical reactions?\n4\nChemical Reactions What happens to chemical bonds during chemical reactions? Chemical reactions involve changes in the chemical bonds that join atoms in compounds.\n5\nChemical Reactions A chemical reaction is a process that changes, or transforms, one set of chemicals into another by changing the chemical bonds that join atoms in compounds. Mass and energy are conserved during chemical transformations, including chemical reactions that occur in living organisms. The elements or compounds that enter into a chemical reaction are known as reactants. The elements or compounds produced by a chemical reaction are known as products.\n7. mcgraw-hill\n8\nChemical Reactions An important chemical reaction in your bloodstream enables carbon dioxide to be removed from the body.\n9\nChemical Reactions As it enters the blood, carbon dioxide (CO2) reacts with water to produce carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is highly soluble. This chemical reaction enables the blood to carry carbon dioxide to the lungs.\n10\nChemical Reactions In the lungs, the reaction is reversed and produces carbon dioxide gas, which you exhale.\n11\nHow do energy changes affect whether a chemical reaction will occur?\nEnergy in Reactions How do energy changes affect whether a chemical reaction will occur?\n12\nEnergy in Reactions How do energy changes affect whether a chemical reaction will occur? Chemical reactions that release energy often occur on their own, or spontaneously. Chemical reactions that absorb energy will not occur without a source of energy.\n14\nEnergy Changes Energy is released or absorbed whenever chemical bonds are formed or broken during chemical reactions. Energy changes are one of the most important factors in determining whether a chemical reaction will occur. Chemical reactions that release energy often occur on their own, or spontaneously. Chemical reactions that absorb energy will not occur without a source of energy.\n15\nEnergy Changes An example of an energy-releasing reaction is the burning of hydrogen gas, in which hydrogen reacts with oxygen to produce water vapor. The energy is released in the form of heat, and sometimes—when hydrogen gas explodes—light and sound.\n16\nEnergy Changes The reverse reaction, in which water is changed into hydrogen and oxygen gas, absorbs so much energy that it generally doesn’t occur by itself. 2H2O + energy 2 H2 + O2 The only practical way to reverse the reaction is to pass an electrical current through water to decompose water into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. Thus, in one direction the reaction produces energy, and in the other direction the reaction requires energy.\n17\nEnergy Sources Every organism must have a source of energy to carry out the chemical reactions it needs to stay alive. Plants get their energy by trapping and storing the energy from sunlight in energy-rich compounds. Animals get their energy when they consume plants or other animals. Humans release the energy needed to grow, breathe, think, and even dream through the chemical reactions that occur when we metabolize, or break down, digested food.\n18\nActivation Energy Chemical reactions that release energy do not always occur spontaneously. The energy that is needed to get a reaction started is called the activation energy.\n19\nActivation Energy The peak of each graph represents the energy needed for the reaction to go forward. The difference between the required energy and the energy of the reactants is the activation energy. Activation energy is involved in chemical reactions whether or not the overall reaction releases or absorbs energy.\n20\nEnzymes What role do enzymes play in living things and what affects their function?\n21\nEnzymes What role do enzymes play in living things and what affects their function? Enzymes speed up chemical reactions that take place in cells. Temperature, pH, and regulatory molecules can affect the activity of enzymes.\n22\nEnzymes Some chemical reactions are too slow or have activation energies that are too high to make them practical for living tissue. These chemical reactions are made possible by catalysts. A catalyst is a substance that speeds up the rate of a chemical reaction. Catalysts work by lowering a reaction’s activation energy.\n23\nNature’s Catalysts Enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts. They speed up chemical reactions that take place in cells. Enzymes act by lowering the activation energies, which has a dramatic effect on how quickly reactions are completed.\n24\nNature’s Catalysts For example, the reaction in which carbon dioxide combines with water to produce carbonic acid is so slow that carbon dioxide might build up in the body faster than the bloodstream could remove it. Your bloodstream contains an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase that speeds up the reaction by a factor of 10 million, so that the reaction takes place immediately and carbon dioxide is removed from the blood quickly.\n25\nNature’s Catalysts Enzymes are very specific, generally catalyzing only one chemical reaction. Part of an enzyme’s name is usually derived from the reaction it catalyzes. Carbonic anhydrase gets its name because it also catalyzes the reverse reaction that removes water from carbonic acid.\n26\nThe Enzyme-Substrate Complex\nFor a chemical reaction to take place, the reactants must collide with enough energy so that existing bonds will be broken and new bonds will be formed. If the reactants do not have enough energy, they will be unchanged after the collision. Enzymes provide a site where reactants can be brought together to react. Such a site reduces the energy needed for reaction.\n27\nThe Enzyme-Substrate Complex\nThe reactants of enzyme-catalyzed reactions are known as substrates. For example, the enzyme carbonic anhydrase converts the substrates carbon dioxide and water into carbonic acid (H2CO3).\n28\nThe Enzyme-Substrate Complex\nThe substrates bind to a site on the enzyme called the active site. The active site and the substrates have complementary shapes. The fit is so precise that the active site and substrates are often compared to a lock and key.\n29\nRegulation of Enzyme Activity\nTemperature, pH, and regulatory molecules are all factors that can affect the activity of enzymes. Enzymes produced by human cells generally work best at temperatures close to 37°C, the normal temperature of the human body. Enzymes work best at certain pH values. For example, the stomach enzyme pepsin, which begins protein digestion, works best under acidic conditions. The activities of most enzymes are regulated by molecules that carry chemical signals within cells, switching enzymes “on” or “off” as needed.\nSimilar presentations","url":"https:\/\/slideplayer.com\/slide\/8060860\/","timestamp":"2019-10-14 09:16:33","dump":"CC-MAIN-2019-43","segment":"1570986648481.7","md5":"69b66aa7eb435b46469b4919c6155174","docid":"falcon_slideplayer.com_69b66aa7eb435b46469b4919c6155174","rand":0.8567736986436915}

{"content":"Campaign Notebook\nThousands of marchers rally before convention\nAn estimated 3,000 demonstrators, most of them protesting against the war, rallied on Boston Common before winding their way through the city and marching past FleetCenter, the downtown arena where the convention will be held. They were accompanied by a ragtag group marching against everything from oppression in Haiti to better funding for schools and health care.\nAt Faneuil Hall, an estimated 1,000 anti-abortion protesters staged a rally before a smaller group set off on their own march toward FleetCenter.\nBrief scuffles broke out when the anti-war and anti-abortion groups crossed paths. Police moved them along, and the marches continued their separate ways after a few moments of confusion. Two people were arrested.\nKerry throws out first pitch at game\nSen. John Kerry made a surprise visit to Boston for the Yankees-Red Sox baseball game yesterday by secretly entering a city tightly secured for the Democratic convention that will nominate him for president.\n\"This plane is diverted,\" Kerry told reporters aboard his chartered Boeing 757 shortly after it left Columbus, Ohio, ostensibly for Titusville, Fla.\nKerry threw the ceremonial first pitch to Will Pumyea, a 23-year-old who served as a military police officer in the U.S. National Guard in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\"It's a wonderful rivalry and it's a great event,\" Kerry said. \"I love the Red Sox, the idea of missing a Yankees-Red Sox series right before convention week was not acceptable.\"\nKerry, who began a six-day, cross-country trek to the convention in Colorado on Friday, will hold a town-hall meeting at Cape Canaveral in Florida today where he will focus on technology and innovation in America. He is scheduled to be back in Boston on Wednesday afternoon.\nArab news channel covering convention\nAmong the international media covering the Democratic National Convention, one name sticks out: Al-Jazeera, the Arab satellite news channel accused by the Bush administration of anti-U.S. bias.\nPerhaps symbolic of its growing influence, Al-Jazeera even has a skybox in the convention hall, along with the U.S. television networks, although it says it was denied a separate sign with its logo.\nStephanie Thomas, manager and spokeswoman for Al-Jazeera's Washington bureau, said Al-Jazeera is in Boston to give the Democrats a forum to reach Arab Americans. However, she says, the Democrats have not responded to Al-Jazeera's requests for interviews with party leaders.\nThomas notes that because Al-Jazeera's largest audience, Arabs in the Middle East, is about eight hours ahead of Boston, live coverage of the convention will be seen by relatively few there. Even so, she says the network plans about 12 hours of live coverage over four days more than the major U.S. networks.\nClark releases delegates to Kerry\nRetired Army Gen. Wesley Clark, one of only two Democrats to win a state primary before bowing to John Kerry, has released his delegates to the Massachusetts senator.\nClark sent an e-mail Friday directing delegates pledged to him in primary contests to cast their first ballots for Kerry on Thursday, Clark spokesman Erick Mullen said.\n\"It is my hope that every Clark for President delegate will assume a leadership role at the convention,\" Clark wrote in the e-mail. \"The most important way you can do that is to stand with John Kerry and John Edwards and cast your vote for them on the first ballot.\"\nClark won the Oklahoma primary by a slim margin over Edwards and finished second to Kerry in Arizona, New Mexico and North Dakota, on his way to 73 pledged delegates.

From the front of The You You Are, “a spiritual biography of you,” author Dr. Ricken Lazlo Hale, PhD, peers earnestly, sporting a maroon turtleneck and feathered hair—Steve Jobs in bard cosplay. “What does ‘camaraderie’ mean?” asks one typically absurd page. “Most linguists agree it comes from the Latin ‘camera,’ which means ‘a device used to take a photograph.’ And of course, the best photographs are not of individuals, but of groups of happy friends, who love each other deeply.” This book is contraband. In the world of Apple TV+’s hit series Severance, in which a chip can be placed in your brain to separate your work life from your personal life, there are outies who live a normal existence and innies who live an entirely corporate one. The only book that should be available within Lumon Industries’ walls is the one written by founder Kier Eagan, which dates back to the 19th century, a handbook\/bible in which every action is mapped out to ensure the innies’ conformity.\nWhich is why Mark (Adam Scott) and his two colleagues handle this new book like a bomb, considering it from a safe distance, with the most devout of the three (John Turturro) moved to quote Eagan with characteristic born-again reverence: “Be content in my words, and dally not in the scholastic pursuits of lesser men.” But The You You Are is inscribed specifically to Mark (“intrepid cartographer of the mind”). And as the one to whom it is addressed, he can’t not answer its call. So he reads it alone. And he has an unsurprising epiphany–how could he not when he’s been so successfully indoctrinated for so long? “Your job needs you,” this new book alerts him, “not the other way around.” Like a teenage boy who has stumbled upon Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Mark is galvanized. So are his fellow office workers, particularly Dylan (Zach Cherry), who has also been reading the book in private. “Our job is to taste free air,” Mark reads aloud. “Your so-called boss may own the clock that taunts you from the wall, but, my friends”—and here, Dylan joins in—“the hour is yours.”\nThe You You Are is the driving force behind Severance, which just concluded its first season to such wall-to-wall critical and fan acclaim that a second season has already been announced. The nine-episode series is as thrilling, dramatic, and dark as it can be ridiculous, and The You You Are is the motor of the worker uprising at its core. “Ben and I talk all the time about this,” says creator Dan Erickson, referring to executive producer and director Ben Stiller. “That’s one of our favorite elements of the whole show. Like, it’s just so delicious.”\nSeverance came out of a pilot Erickson submitted to Stiller’s production company (Red Hour Films) as a writing sample, but the idea that The You You Are would end up in the hands of the innies was not part of the original script—it came out of the writers room. However, Mark’s brother-in-law, Ricken (played by veteran stage actor Michael Chernus), was there from the beginning, always as a thorn in Mark’s side. Ricken’s the author of several books—The You You Are follows the equally ingeniously named My Own Petard and The Life of an American Gadfly—a pompous enunciator who speaks in ye olde style. He is the kind of guy who weaves his own pajamas and partakes of the neti pot. “Part of it was just outlining the horribleness and the depressing nature of Mark’s life,” Erickson tells me, “how his only real social interactions are with these people that he really doesn’t connect with at all.” But it was the particular loathing Mark had for Ricken—which Mark was primed for in the wake of his wife Gemma’s recent death—that unlocked the story. “It’s like, Oh, my God, innie Mark has to somehow be exposed to his words and be totally inspired by him,” says Erickson. “What would piss off outie Mark more than that?” The story line also gave Ricken the depth Mark seemed incapable of seeing in him. “Once that idea was there, it was like, Well, let’s make Ricken the father of the revolution,” Erickson explains. “Let’s basically make Ricken’s book the manifesto for this workers revolution.”\nRicken and Lumon founder Eagan were always intended to be “different sides of the same coin,” Erickson adds: “They’re gussying up these almost commonsense ideas to make it sound like something more profound than is actually there.” The difference, though, is that Ricken wants to bring comfort, while Eagan wants to bring compliance. Because of that, their two books become opposing forces within the office and the lives of the innies. “It’s funny because we’re seeing this silly self-help book go up against this gross corporate document, and they’re [both] vying for supremacy in the minds and hearts of the workers,” Erickson says. “It just becomes: Which ideology is going to win out?”\nBecause Severance required a delicate tonal balance, Ricken couldn’t be over the top. Erickson notes that even though he has met people like him, on the page even real people can read as excessive. But having worked in theater for years, Chernus knew his character well. “I have so many friends—some of them are dear friends—who are pretentious,” he says with a laugh. He was fueled by the actors playing Ricken’s friends, who first appear at a food-free dinner party, among them Grace Rex as dotty bird owner Rebeck (no a) and Donald Webber Jr. as eager-to-please Patton. “You felt that artistic community sort of thing from the get-go,” Chernus says. “We were always joking about the no-dinner dinner party—feasting on ideas, having an appetite for discourse.”\nChernus isn’t certain he didn’t slip into parody occasionally; it was just too tempting. “It’s a fine line between what’s too much and what’s just right with him,” he says. But while Ricken does serve as a “little release valve” for the pathos-laden Severance, he can’t be reduced to comic relief. Chernus tried to home in on Ricken’s humanity, to “maybe understand what some of the character’s wound is.” He points to the scene that takes place on the night of his wife Devon’s (Jen Tullock) labor. While she is experiencing contractions, her husband is holding on to her for dear life, crying as though he is in labor himself (this is one of Erickson’s favorite moments in the show). “I just don’t want to be like my father,” Ricken laments, before straightening up the moment Mark arrives. If you aren’t paying attention, the line is easy to miss, but it’s essential to understanding the author of The You You Are. As Chernus explains, “I think he’s trying to fill a pretty big hole in himself with all of this.”","md5":"c2483ae66d9091773c1caa4035818974","docid":"ccwarc_www.vanityfair.com_c2483ae66d9091773c1caa4035818974","rand":0.8567737015281757}

{"content":"There are several pages here detailing different scams directed at boat sellers. The new Page 4 is a scam directed at boat buyers!\nI would like to say that 99% of boat buyers are totally honest - it is easy to get paranoid about scams.\nTHEY MAY SAY THEY CAN'T TALK ON THE PHONE - ON AN OIL RIG FOR EXAMPLE.\nNew scam July 2018. This 'gentleman' says he wants the boat for his wife's birthday. Sends the seller a check. Then he wants to withdraw from the sale, and says he will give the seller some money for their trouble. DO NOT send any money back to this scammer. His check will eventually appear as fraudulent.\n1 - a thread of several unrelated addresses - a scam buyer said he was in Michigan; the return address on the Fed Express envelope was Hawaii; the check had 3 different states on it.\n2 - the check is always for more money than the transaction amount- a transaction amount for $1900; the check for $3000. Various excuses for this - usually that they want you (the seller) to pay a \"shipper\" and then after you have done this, you find that the original check bounces.\nPlease see the rest of these pages, which outline different scenarios.\nThese scams are not directed solely at boat sellers, they will try anything for sale on the net! Send the url of this page worldwide and let's get these guys back to an honest living.\nThe purchase scam goes like this: they want to buy your boat for $2,000, but they have a debtor who owes them $7500 in the states, and they want the debtor to pay you the $7500 by check and have you wire them the difference of $5500, Western Union. Then you find out the check is bogus.\nThey also counterfeit US Postal Money Orders, millions of dollars of these have been found! The best way to identify a genuine postal money order, postal service officials say, is to look for the telltale watermark, which, when held up to the light, should reveal an image of Benjamin Franklin. Genuine postal money orders also have a security strip running alongside the watermark, just to the right. If held to the light, a microfiber strip will show the letters \"USPS\" along its length.\nThanks for the response, actually I am sorry that I could no longer come to view it because I had a change in my work schedule and will be very busy. Just to let you know that am okay with the condition and price of the boat. I am ready to make instant purchase. My mode of payment would be in Cashier's Check via UPS or Fed Ex 1\/2days delivery.\nI'll arrange for a local pick up as soon as you get the check cashed and have your money in hand , and i promise everything will go smoothly.Kindly get back to me with your full name and address including your cell number, so i can overnight the payment to you and i will let you know when its mailed out.\nHello Seller, I'm Scott, I am writing you concerning your posted Boat placed for sale on sailingtexas.com, do you still have it available for sale???\nThank you, I am okay with the price and condition, I'm willing to offer you a check for payment and I'll be handling the shipment aspect,I have a reputable shipping company that I'll instruct to come and pick it up from you after you've received the payment and it has clears your bank and you have your cash at hand.. Ok?\nOne of my sellers said the boat was $100,000. (Actually about 11K.) He still responded with the above answer!\nThis sent to me from a seller.\nHenry Wesley is trying to pull a scam on boat sellers. He also uses the name Charles Elmore, and Sadde Pemberton.\nHe sent me a check for full payment, and the day after he deposited it he emailed to rescind the sale and asked for a refund by way of wire transfer. His check was false, from a bank called TD Bank in Florida.\nI am interested in buying your boat. I came across the listing on www.sailingtexas.com. Is it still available for sale?\nYes it is still for sale. I just had a trailer custom made for it, and it is now in mast up ready to drop the mast. Here are a couple of extra pics.\n*Full Name as it should appear on the payment.\nI will arrange for a check to be sent to you while the survey and inspection will be done at a later date. I would also contact a shipping company regarding the haulage.\nThe payment had been sent to you. Kindly track the shipment at either canadapost.ca OR usps.com.\nIt is unfortunate to inform you that I received a phone call early this morning that my dad passed away over the night. This is a great shock to me as I was dumbfounded.\nI never imagined this happening at this time and I would have to let go the boat I intended buying for him as there will be no need for it anymore since he is no more alive.\nI would like you to kindly deduct $2000 from my funds due to the inconveniences and expenses you may have incurred during the process of selling this boat to me as I understand you may have incurred some expenses.\nI would get back to you with the information on how to refund my money asap. Thank you so much for your understanding.\nI understand completely. Once the cheque clears I will send your money. Please give me a remittance address.\n\"Paypal\" scam. 8\/2016 Take care if the 'buyer' insists on paying by Paypal and wants new photos of your boat. After the funds clear, they have their shipper fetch the boat. Sometimes they leave a receipt for pick up with an address that it will be shipped to, but who knows where it goes and later, the buyer claims that the product was never received (shipped to a different address - or was \"lost\"). They then get a refund AND a free boat with new pictures so they can sell it.\nAGAIN, ALWAYS ask for a phone number, call it and don't take any excuse as to why a buyer can't speak on the phone.\nThe Paypal logo looks legitimate.\nYou have received a PayPal Payment of $15,300.00 from Kenneth Hill.\nIn order to complete this transaction and get the funds approved in your account. We advice you go to nearest Western Union Office,and send the $1,250 to the Agent and send us a Scanned Copy\/Photograph of your Western Union Transaction Receipt (in .JPG Format) with the Western Union Money Transfer Control Number (MTCN) in details.\nGood day, I saw your item from site,which you placed on advert for sale.

{"content":"“Dream all you will, dare all you can, and do all you must.” ~ Matshona Dhliwayo\n“What do you want to be when you grow up?” my father’s friends liked to question me when I was young. “A lawyer, a teacher, or a fireman?” they would further quiz, hinting to me the kinds of professions I should aim for.\nBut, I had a different idea of what I wanted to be when I grew up. “I want to be rich!” I would reply emphatically, causing them to burst into laughter tinged with sarcasm. I could have resented them, or worse still, given up on my dreams. Instead, I persevered until I prevailed, and now doors have opened for me to travel the world inspiring millions to not give up on their dreams.\nIf you are on the verge of giving up on your dreams, asking yourself why you should press on, below are seven reasons why.\n- up on your dreams, therefore, is giving up on your financial rewards, whereas continuously pursuing them is continuously pursuing prosperity.\n- Self-actualization. No matter how much money and fame you acquire, you will never be happy until you experience self-fulfillment. We come into this world for a purpose, and until it is realized, we will never feel whole, always feeling incomplete. To live your best life, therefore, persevere in the pursuit of your dreams.\n- Better the world. The world is incomplete without you. Something is missing which only you can bring. You were born at this particular time for a particular purpose. If you give up on your dreams, you give up on the world; but, if you press on, you will inevitably achieve your dreams, your unique contributions making the world a better place.\n- Inspire others. When you persevere in the pursuit of your dreams, you inspire those who watch you wrestle and overcome obstacles. Inspiration is the catalyst for all great achievements. To better the world, you have to better men, and to better men, you have to inspire them.\n- Develop inner strength. When chasing your dreams, it is inevitable that you will carry fear, doubt, and despair, along with a myriad of other things you shouldn’t carry. This consequently trains your mind’s muscles, your heart’s muscles, and your soul’s muscles, consciously or subconsciously. Life only rewards you in proportion to what you are able to carry.\n- Legacy. When you reach a ripe old age, if you are wise, you will ask yourself: “What am I leaving behind that says ‘I was here?’ Have I made my mark on the world?” You will inevitably wonder if your descendants will remember you—if your name will live on.\nThe greatest way to ensure it never dies in the hearts and minds of people is to never give up on your dreams. Would we remember the pharaohs of old if they had not completed the pyramids? Or the scribes of old if they had not completed their masterpieces?Never give in to the temptation of giving up on your dreams. Set the bar high for posterity. Your legacy, in terms of achievements, is the greater inheritance you can pass down to your children and your children’s children; worth more than any silver or gold.\n- Silence your haters. When pursuing your dreams, there will be those cheering you on, those sabotaging you, and those who are not concerned whether you succeed or fail. In light of this, keep chasing your dreams until you achieve them. The best and only solution is to keep pressing on. Critics are loud, but success is louder.","url":"http:\/\/africanleadership.co.uk\/7-reasons-not-give-dreams\/","timestamp":"2018-10-15 19:04:31","dump":"CC-MAIN-2018-43","segment":"1539583509170.2","md5":"8b80e0576e25a503134a7d0e24babd5e","docid":"falcon_africanleadership.co.uk_8b80e0576e25a503134a7d0e24babd5e","rand":0.8567737097775623}

Her father was drawn to farming after serving as a pilot in the Navy and commercially, and ended up purchasing a 95-acre plot near Paso Robles, California, in 1997. He planted 65 of its acres with Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, with the intention of selling all the fruit. With the encouragement of local winemakers, he decided to enter the winemaking arena, founding Pianetta Winery in 2002.\nAlthough she most of her early life living in Fresno, Caitlin spent weekends and summers working at the vineyard. This experience led her to enroll in California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, earning a B.S. degree in Agribusiness in 2004, coincidentally the year when the winery officially released its first vintage of estate Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.\nNot surprisingly given her academic background, Caitlin started her career in the wine industry on the business side, joining the family business in mid-2004 and overseeing sales and marketing of its wines. As the winery expanded and offered other red varietals, she became more interested in the winemaking process itself. She describes her journey to becoming a winemaker in the following way: “At first, I was just doing what my dad told me to do. Then I started really paying attention to what was going on, and asking questions” — and doing more research, and reading books, and going to seminars, and making suggestions … and then, eventually, making the wines. I got more and more involved, pushing to do more and more.”\nCaitlin is creative in her winemaking and, at only five feet in height, how she manages cellar work, saying, “It’s very physically demanding, moving barrels around, stuff like that, so I’ve found ways to adapt the winery, do it my way.” She continues to work in the vineyard, which is now home to Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Petite Sirah, and Petite Verdot vines. The Cab and Syrah continue to be estate wines, whereas several other varietals such as Sangiovese, Barbera, and Zinfandel are crafted from sourced fruit.","md5":"44c6f3873d8d79a35dc41d4d08617bbc","docid":"ccwarc_webpages.scu.edu_44c6f3873d8d79a35dc41d4d08617bbc","rand":0.8567737108288269}
{"content":"When it comes to healthy beverages, there are plenty fruits that you can pick. The only thing you need to do is to blend those fruits and turn them into juice that you can drink for breakfast, after going to the gym, or even when you are just watching your favorite TV show.\nMany fruits are available to choose that you can make as healthy juices. They have good colors that can make you drool, and taste that are surely satisfying to the appetite. The most important of all is that you absorb the essential nutrients in your body. If you want the best and healthiest fruits for a glass of juice, here are five of them.\nLemon is one of the best and common fruit juice ingredients for many years. This is because lemon is a fruit that give lots of benefits for the health. Do you know that there are hidden secrets of lemon juice that concern optimum health? Yes, this is true as lemon contains magnesium, limonene, bioflavonoids, citric acid, vitamin C, pectin and calcium. That is why this fruit is known as antiviral and antioxidant. It boosts the immune system, helps lose extra pounds, and flushes bacteria or toxins down from the body. So, drink up lots of lemon juice everyday to make your cells healthy.\nCranberry is also a very healthy fruit. This primarily cures urinary tract infection (UTI). It is also known for its antioxidant and vitamin C benefits. This juice can be mixed with water and other sweeteners of your choice just to minimize the acidity of the juice. But you can always prepare a pitcher or a glass of blended fresh cranberries without mixing anything.\nThe water of coconut, which is also called as miracle water, is a good alternative beverage of soda and other sugary drinks. Coconut water is pure so expect zero sugar at all. There are also no chemicals added. Its transparent color makes it a good water alternative to drink as well. Like cranberry, coconut juice is also able to treat UTI. It cleanses the urine storage by means of urinating. When you drink a glass or coconut juice, there is a tendency for you to urinate and remove toxins stored in your bladder.\nGrapes are a common ingredient in many types of beverages, including wine. But to keep this drink healthier, it is better that you make it as a simple juice. You need to absorb the antioxidant benefits of this fruit, so do not try mixing it with other ingredients, especially an alcohol. According to research studies, it shows that Concord grape juice is a good drink to minimize blood pressure and reduce heart disease. Therefore, take time to drink a glass or more of this fruit juice, too.\nThis fruit is also among the healthiest ingredients for juice drinks. It contains lots of vitamins that can help your body become healthier and skin to look younger. It is also a good protection from certain diseases, including cancers like prostate cancer, and cardiovascular disease.\nAnother fruit that is rich in antioxidant properties is blueberry. It is also known as a great source of vitamin C and fiber. There are also research studies conducted in which they found out that blueberry is beneficial for age-related cognitive abilities. Nevertheless, this fruit is not only nutritious but also very delicious to sip on a daily basis.\nRemember how healthy lemon, coconut, cranberry, pomegranate, Concord grapes and blueberry are. They are available almost all seasons, so making juices for your regular drink won’t be a problem. It should be your habit to daily drink fresh fruit juices, especially if they contain lots of vitamins, like the ones mentioned on the list above.\nWhatever fruit your pick to drink, they will make you free from diseases and protect you from suffering ailments, or at least help prevent and cure illnesses that you probably have right now. There should be no excuses and other purposes to sip a glass or two of these juices if it can contribute to your optimum health.","md5":"6d9e640f1c3a2205cbe9426f11ab7c22","docid":"redpajama_c4_6d9e640f1c3a2205cbe9426f11ab7c22","rand":0.8567737112879883}

So not only did I want to get their CD, but also have a look at this movie. And what an impressive experience it turned out to be.\nThe power of the sea, its overwhelming might, through this black on white eye. No hiding here (we’re all in this together).

Giving ART users who smoke the support and help they need to quit should therefore be a part of routine efforts to improve their health and longevity.\nResearchers in France conducted a well-designed study of the smoking cessation medicine varenicline (Champix, Chantix) vs. placebo. They found that varenicline was significantly better than placebo at helping people quit, however, overall, its effects were modest. Furthermore, they judged varenicline to be generally safe.\nBased on these results and the many health benefits of smoking cessation, the researchers encourage healthcare providers to offer smoking cessation assistance to their HIV-positive patients.\nResearchers recruited participants who were motivated to quit smoking (as assessed by a questionnaire). Having any other addictions, suffering from depression and having previously used varenicline disqualified people from participating in this study.\nParticipants who received varenicline were given gradually increased doses so as to minimize the risk of developing nausea.\nAll participants received individualized face-to-face counselling sessions. The counsellors had been trained in encouraging behavioural change in smokers. During the first session, counsellors initially explored participants’ motivations and fears about quitting. Participants could have up to 15 counselling sessions over the course of the study.\nThe study had a complex design, as follows:\nFor the first 12 weeks participants took either varenicline or placebo pills and underwent counselling.\nThis was followed by a period of 13 consecutive weeks of no pills; counselling continued.\nAt the 26th week, participants who had initially quit and who relapsed during the study were offered a 12-week course of varenicline. Those who accepted this offer were monitored up to the 48th week of the study after they completed the 12-week course of varenicline.\nThe average profile of participants upon entering the study was as follows:\nage – 45 years\n83% men, 17% women\nduration of HIV diagnosis – 13 years\ntaking ART – 94%\nhaving a viral load less than 50 copies\/mL – 76%\nyears of smoking – 26\nhistory of trying to quit smoking at least once – 82%\nParticipants had regular study appointments for assessments, including measurement of carbon monoxide levels in exhaled air (to confirm abstinence from smoking).\nA note about placebo\nThe placebo was designed to have a similar “presentation, colour, taste and smell” to varenicline. According to the researchers, the placebo was designed to be “biologically inactive”; that is, it would not cause any effect on participants. As the trial was double-blind, the participants and researchers (except for one) did not know who received varenicline or placebo until after the end of the study. This blinding was important, as during the study researchers were asked to assess any perceived problems (symptoms, complications) that participants reported and decide if they were caused by the study medication.\nA total of 123 participants were randomized to receive varenicline and 124 participants received placebo for the first 12 weeks of the study.\nResults—Short term\nResearchers initially focused on quit rates that occurred starting at week nine to the end of week 12 on varenicline or placebo. During this period quit rates were as follows:\nvarenicline – 29% of participants were able to quit\nplacebo – 11% of participants were able to quit\nThis difference was statistically significant; that is, not likely due to chance alone.\nResults—Long term\nWhen researchers took all of their data into account from weeks nine to 48, the proportions of participants who were able to remain free from smoking were distributed as follows:\nplacebo – 6% of participants were able to quit\nAlthough more people who used varenicline compared to placebo quit smoking, the proportion of varenicline users who quit is modest.\nImpact of the counsellor on quitting\nThere were two types of counsellors deployed during the study, which took place at hospital clinics. One was a smoking cessation counsellor, called a tobaccologist, who specialized in helping mostly HIV-negative people quit smoking. The other counsellor was an infectious disease specialist who also had experience and training in helping patients quit smoking. When researchers analysed quit rates by the type of counsellor, they found the following results at week 48:\ninfectious disease specialist counsellor – 20% were not smoking\nregular smoking cessation counsellor – 11% were not smoking\nregular smoking cessation counsellor – 3% were not smoking\nThese differences in quit rates by the type of counsellor were statistically significant. The researchers suspected that these differences “might reflect the use of a more tailored intervention by the infectious disease specialist because, for example, they might be able to understand specific barriers faced by people living with HIV, which might be less prevalent in the general population that a tobaccologist is familiar with.”\nThe term adverse events is used to describe a range of unfortunate incidents that can occur in a clinical trial. Only some of these events are caused by the study medicine(s). As this was a placebo-controlled study, researchers have a good idea of which side effects were caused by varenicline.\nAccording to the researchers, “most adverse events were [mild-to-moderate intensity] and were mainly gastrointestinal or [neuropsychiatric].”\nThe proportions of participants with an adverse event that was judged to be related to the study medicines (for this report we include placebo as a medicine) were distributed as follows:\nvarenicline – 48% (49 people)\nplacebo – 39% (43 people)\nThe proportions of participants with an adverse event that was judged to be related to the study medicines (for this report we include placebo as a medicine) and that was judged to be serious were distributed as follows:\nvarenicline – 7% (seven people)\nplacebo – 6% (seven people)\nThe difference in distribution rates was not statistically significant.\nThese serious adverse events were distributed as follows (some participants reported more than one adverse event):\nvarenicline – two people\nplacebo – two people\nvarenicline – one person\nplacebo – one person\nBehavioural disorders (details were not provided)\nplacebo – zero\nvarenicline – zero\nFeeling weak\nNo one died as a result of the study medicines. One person died from wounds sustained from a physical assault unrelated to the study.\nFocus on depression\nSome studies suggest that people with mental health issues may be more likely to smoke tobacco. Other clinical trials and analyses have assessed the safety of varenicline (including its potential risk for depression). In the present study, the proportions of people who developed depression during the study were as follows:\nvarenicline – 2%\nplacebo – 10%\nThus, exposure to varenicline likely did not increase the risk for depression in this study. Also, there was no significantly increased risk of cardiovascular complications (heart attack, stroke) among varenicline users.\nLab test results\nThe proportions of participants with very abnormal lab test results during the study were as follows (note that none of these were judged to be caused by the study medicines):\nplacebo – 8%\nThere was no pattern to these abnormal lab tests, as different organ-systems were affected.\nThere was no impact of varenicline or placebo on CD4+ cell counts or viral load.\nBear in mind\nThis well-designed study showed that varenicline resulted in modest recovery in a group of longtime smokers. Varenicline (combined with counselling) can clearly help some HIV-positive people to quit smoking. Smoking cessation is difficult but necessary and it is possible that HIV-positive people have additional barriers that make smoking cessation more difficult than it is for HIV-negative people. Researchers in the United States who reviewed the results of the French study stated in a commentary in the journal Lancet HIV that “the characteristics associated with high smoking prevalence in [HIV-negative people] …are probably also important barriers to smoking cessation in people living with HIV.” These barriers include the following:\nalcohol and\/or other substance use\nco-existing mental health conditions\nlow socio-economic status\nlow levels of education\nThe U.S. reviewers said that one important result from the French study is that serious side effects from varenicline were uncommon and this should reassure potential prescribers. A smaller study done in Ontario several years ago also found that varenicline was safe and it helped some HIV-positive people quit smoking.\nBoth the reviewers and the study researchers encourage healthcare practitioners to offer smoking cessation to their patients who smoke.\nHow to Say “I Quit”—and Mean It - The Positive Side\nBreak it off – Health Canada\nTobacco and your health – Santé et services sociaux Québec\nGet help to quit smoking – Canadian Cancer Society\nHow to quit smoking – The Lung Association\nUnderstanding tobacco addiction – CATIE News\nVarenicline—An Ontario study assesses safety in HIV-positive people – CATIE News\nSmoking cessation: Innovative group therapy–centered support found to double quit rate – CATIE News\nDanish study underscores link between heart attacks and smoking – CATIE News\n—Sean R.

A marriage penalty exists when a state’s income brackets for married taxpayers filing jointly are less than double the bracket widths that apply to single filers.\nFifteen states have a marriage penalty built into their income tax bracket structure: California, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin.\nSeven additional states fail to double bracket widths but offset their marriage penalty in the bracket structure by allowing married taxpayers to file separately on the same return, avoiding loss of credits and exemptions. These states are Arkansas, Delaware, Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia.\nTen states have a graduated-rate income tax but double their brackets to avoid a marriage penalty: Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, and Oregon.\nThe ability to file separately on the same return is important in states that do not double bracket widths, and so is the ability to do so even if the couple files jointly for federal purposes.\n“While married couples have the option of filing separately—though some states only allow this if it is also done on their federal forms—this normally creates a disadvantage,” Cammenga said. “It either disallows or reduces the value of deductions and credits available to the family jointly, which is also a form of marriage penalty. Filing separately on the same return eliminates this problem but is slightly more complex than doubling tax brackets for joint filers so that there is no penalty for filing jointly.”","md5":"67f3cca264a702112dd33f41b7f91951","docid":"ccwarc_njbia.org_67f3cca264a702112dd33f41b7f91951","rand":0.8567737224619677}

Both earlier than and after the 1832 Reform Act there have been some who advocated that women should have the right to vote in parliamentary elections. After the enactment of the Reform Act, the MP Henry Hunt argued that any lady who was single, a taxpayer and had sufficient property ought to be allowed to vote. One such rich girl, Mary Smith, was used on this speech for example.\nAnd two women have been nominated for best director – the primary time a couple of girl has been shortlisted for that prize within the awards’ ninety three-yr history. This book examines the British government’s response to the ‘superfluous women problem’, and issues about submit-struggle unemployment extra usually, by making a migration society that was tasked with reducing the number of single women at house by way of overseas migration. The Society for the Oversea Settlement of British Women was created in 1919 to facilitate the transportation of female migrants to the former white settler colonies. To achieve this, the SOSBW worked with various domestic and dominion groups to search out essentially the most appropriate women for migration, while additionally assembly the dominions’ demands for specific types of employees, significantly women for work in home service. While the Society initially aimed to fulfill its unique mandate, it steadily developed its personal imaginative and prescient of empire settlement and refocused its efforts on aiding the migration of educated and educated women who were in search of new, modern, and professional work alternatives abroad.

However such payments hardly ever pass and so this was an ineffective method of truly achieving the vote. There is a poll e-book from 1843 that clearly shows thirty women’s names among those that voted. Due to the excessive rates that she paid, Grace Brown was entitled to 4 votes. The Chartist Movement, which started in the late 1830s, has also been instructed to have included supporters of feminine suffrage.

The problem of parliamentary reform declined together with the Chartists after 1848 and solely reemerged with the election of John Stuart Mill in 1865. He stood for office exhibiting direct support for feminine suffrage and was an MP in the run up to the second Reform Act. Until the 1832 Great Reform Act specified ‘male individuals’, a couple of women had been in a position to vote in parliamentary elections through property possession, though this was rare. In local authorities elections, women lost the proper to vote beneath the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.

{"content":"Lauren Heerschap\nAbout the Image(s)\nI decided to have some fun with a lightbox and create some Christmas cards. Here is one that I thought was fun. Taken at ISO 200, 60mm macro lens, f2.8, 1\/125 sec on my Olympus EM-1 Mark 3, with a focus stack of 9 images. At first I tried using a tripod, but is was so cumbersome to point the camera down and try to focus that I gave up and hand held this. I like the translucent effect of the begonia flowers that were from my hanging baskets.\nHow would you change or improve this since it is a card?\n4 comments posted\nI love backlit flowers. I would try a tighter crop like the one I attached. I would also try whitening the background more, and perhaps bringing out a bit more of the red. This will be a great card. OR--leave the crop as is and just lighten that dark stem on the upper right, and lighten the dark spots on the berries.\n  Posted: 11\/13\/2021 12:38:57\n  Posted: 11\/13\/2021 12:38:57\nHi Lauren, The lightbox has produced beautiful tonality. I like the image uncropped. In fact I would like to see the entire petals at left and bottom. My only other suggestion would be to remove (clone or smart fill) the brown spots on the leaves at right to complete the look of perfection. Very nice. It will make a great card image on gloss or matte paper. Karl   Posted: 11\/15\/2021 09:57:55\nLauren, There is something about the way you handled the flowers that forces to me to want to keep looking at them. I agree with Karl on the spots on the green. his crop is a good way of eliminating the dark edges of the white petals.   Posted: 11\/18\/2021 21:49:03\nThis is really lovely, and will make a wonderful Xmas card.\nI really like Judith's version with lightening the dark tones and her cropping.

An opportunity to pursue the MSc Cancer & Therapeutics Programme as a UK Commonwealth Scholar gave me a pat on the back to move forward in life on a quest to make a difference in the lives of cancer patients.\nThroughout my career in medicine, I have been educated in Australia, the US, China but my education at Queen Mary had a human touch! My mentors Professor Richard Grose, Dr Tony Ford, Professor Jude Fitzgibbon were exceptionally dedicated to the welfare of students. The faculty at Queen Mary are highly intellectual and the programme is brilliantly designed. It starts with basic cancer biology, pharmacology and rapidly delves into how the basic science is useful in designing therapeutics for cancer patients.\nI am an honor roll medical graduate with a Masters in Neuroscience and a Masters in Cancer & Therapeutics. I have also completed training in Neurosurgical Oncology. I presently run a cancer foundation to help treat cancer patients from underprivileged backgrounds and am about to embark on a doctoral quest to find new treatments for brain cancers at one of the oldest institutions in the world.\nThe MSc Cancer & Therapeutics programme proved to be critical in shaping my life following my mother’s death. The level of information I learned at times had me flabbergasted. It helped me to publish with the Royal Society and receive appreciation from great cancer researchers, and gave me the confidence to successfully face a panel of more than 50 interviewers simultaneously. I hope to make my teachers at Barts Cancer Institute proud by making a commendable impact in the field of cancer therapeutics in the years to come.\nI am grateful to Her Majesty The Queen for providing me with such a tremendous opportunity to be educated at the Barts Cancer Institute and Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal, Chancellor of the University of London, for her kind motivation following my graduation from Queen Mary.\nRegardless of your background in medicine or science, if you have a strong passion for learning about cancer therapeutics, you should definitely take this course. The course provides access to world-class researchers and almost every peer-review journal, so if you have a determination to learn then you can get the most out of it. Having been to both the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Barts Cancer Institute, I strongly recommend this course as I believe it will help equip you to face the top institutions across the globe and deliver a stellar performance.","md5":"32604cb427dc2836b0779af73e00013d","docid":"ccwarc_www.bartscancer.london_32604cb427dc2836b0779af73e00013d","rand":0.8567737243503573}
{"content":"Army Corps Confirms No Breakwater Changes Approach\nBy Martin Wisckol\nSpecial to the Grunion\nA 23-year push by surfers to remove the Long Beach breakwater and return waves to the area is evolving into something else altogether.\nInstead of removing any of the 2 1\/2-mile offshore structure, an Army Corps Of Engineers study favors building new marine-life habitat — including kelp beds and rocky reefs — to restore habitat lost to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.\n“In the end, the environmental benefits of modifying the breakwater did not merit federal approval,” Army Corps Col. Aaron Barta said during the first of two public meetings about the plans that took place Monday, Dec. 9.\nBarta then pitched the upside of the Corps’ proposal: “This is an environmental restoration treasure that provides direct benefits to the city of Long Beach and its people, and to the underwater ecosystem in the bay.”\nThe Long Beach chapter of the Surfrider Foundation has led the charge to remove the breakwater and previously has expressed disappointment in the Army Corps direction.\nBut at Monday’s afternoon meeting at the Aquarium of the Pacific — a second session was scheduled for Monday evening — only one of the 11 members of the public who speak about the proposal was a surfer, while most of the others endorsed the Army Corps approach.\nSupporters included those who said marine operations and homes on the Peninsula would be jeopardized by removing even parts of the breakwater in east San Pedro Bay.\n“Letting more waves into the bay will have serious consequences,” said Tom Jacobsen, president of a company that pilots cargo ships into the port.\nThe most commonly expressed concern with the Corps’ plan was that proposed kelp beds, near the entrance of Alamitos Bay, would snag recreational boaters.\nUpsides, Downsides\nRemoving portions of the breakwater, which was completed in 1949 to protect Navy ships then harboring in the area, would cost between $670 million and $1 billion.\nIt also would jeopardize structures built after the breakwater, including oil extraction islands, marinas and homes, according to the Corps’ report released Nov. 25.\nAdditionally, the Corps’ listed a national security concern, noting that the Navy uses an area just inside the breakwater to transfer munitions from ship to ship.\nInstead, the Corps’ top three alternatives would introduce varying amounts of rock reefs, kelp and eel grass habitat, and oyster beds to the east bay.\nThe Corps preferred alternative, dubbed the Reef Restoration Plan, would create open water and nearshore rocky reefs, kelp beds and eel grass habitat. It would cover a total of 201 acres in several portions of the bay and would cost an estimated $141 million to construct.\nAnother alternative would cover 162 acres and cost $84 million; a third would cover 372 acres and cost $561 million.\nBut the plan is not yet a done deal, as the Army Corps is taking comments before finalizing its proposal. The Long Beach City Council also will have a say, as the city and Corps are partners in the $3 million study and in any subsequent construction.\n“The council can pick a different alternative, but if they pick the breakwater (removal), it’s not supported by the data,” Acting City Manager Tom Modica told the Southern California News Group upon release of the Nov. 25 report.\n“Ultimately, it comes down to science. And the Army Corps determined that (removing the breakwater) wasn’t viable.”\nPraying For Surf\nThe Corps’ study stems from a push launched in 1996 by surfers who wanted to remove the entire 2.5-mile rock structure and let surf-friendly waves return to the area. Before the breakwater was built, the city’s beachfront was dubbed the ‘Waikiki of the West Coast’ and, in 1938, it hosted what’s been billed as the first surf contest on the mainland United States.\nThe breakwater is the easternmost — and most recent — of three such barriers in the bay. Naval ships that it was built to protect have since moved out of the area.\nThe Long Beach chapter of the Surfrider Foundation was formed in 1998 with the motto, “Bring back the waves” and a mission of removing the breakwater.\nIn 2009, the city completed a study that found removing the breakwater would return surf to the area and improve the quality of both the water and the local beach.\nThat, in turn, could spur a resurgence of beach-related tourism that would generate an estimated $52 million annually in local spending and economic activity, along with nearly $7 million in taxes and parking fees, according to the study.\nIn 2012, the Army Corps study was launched. Barta said construction was likely to take place from 2027 to 2030.\nArmy Corps Recommendations Leave Long Beach Breakwater Alone\nThe Long Beach Breakwater should not be altered, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\nArmy Corps Talks About Big Dredging Project In Port Of Long Beach\nTwo meetings on Nov. 13 will be used to unveil a draft feasibility report and Environmental …\nArmy Corps Of Engineers","md5":"9976d4b5f36ec4c4af7552d6bf2a524e","docid":"redpajama_common-crawl_9976d4b5f36ec4c4af7552d6bf2a524e","rand":0.8567737246976492}

Given that the Doctor has a Tardis, this isn't really a big deal because he can arrive back moments after he left. I'm not sure that the Doctor had that in mind when he made that vow but with a new companion after so long, he simply cannot stay put and the chance to give Bill a peek at the universe is compelling to him.\nBill has gotten used to the idea that the Tardis is larger on the inside but that doesn't mean that she thinks that it makes sense or constitutes what she deems to be a proper space ship. For instance, why are the chairs so far away from the console? The tenth Doctor explained that the Tardis was actually meant to be controlled by six people, so perhaps the chairs are so far away so that one can get an actual break when a rest is needed. The Doctor also reveals that he stole the Tardis but if you recall in The Doctor's Wife, the Tardis claims that it was she who in fact stole him because she wanted to travel and see the universe. It's then that the Tardis reveals that she takes him where he needs to be which explains why wherever the Doctor lands, there's a problem which needs to be solved and why he sometimes misses the mark so badly when he tries to return to a specific point in time.\nBill like Rose chooses to go to the future first and akin to Rose is disturbed by the idea that humans have fled earth. Sure, Bill isn't seeing the end of the world; however, the very idea that humanity felt the need to leave earth is disturbing to her. Bill and the Doctor land on an new outpost built by humanity and find it devoid of life. The Doctor may not have been there before but he's not surprised by its existence given that he's run into human life preservers before in The Beast Below. Similarly to Ark in Space, humanity has made the trip in suspended animation, a factor the Doctor learns just before he can destroy the new habitat because of robots run amok.\nThe Doctor may change every time that he regenerates but some things always remain the same. The Doctor very strongly believes that he has a duty of care when it comes to his companions, even though he routinely places them in dangerous situations when it comes to his various adventures. It's certain that wherever the Tardis lands that there's going to a mystery which needs to be solved. Bill is initially amused by the robots who sport emojii faces. I think that there should be a shaming tax on the Japanese for burdening us with emojiis in the first damn place.\nThe robots have been programmed to make humans happy and take that job very seriously. When the few humans who awake early experience unhappiness in the form of grief because a member of their party has passed on, the robots respond by turning them all into fertilizer. The robots don't know how to handle or understand grief and therefore decide that the solution is to simply remove the humans which are unhappy. The Doctor and Bill race back to the Tardis where he decides to leave her behind in order to keep her safe. Left alone with the Tardis Bill takes the time to really focus on the outside and in particular the sign which says call if you need help. This I suppose is the moment when Bill concludes that the Doctor is some kind of interstellar policeman whom the universe calls when it needs help. Though this isn't technically accurate even though the Doctor has been contacted various way over the years for help, it feels right.\nOf course when the humans find out that the robots have killed others who failed to be happy, their response is to grab some guns and try to kill the robots. It's a stark reminder why humanity finds itself in so many problems because the first answer is always violence, rather than negotiation or understanding. When the humans inevitably pass out, the Doctor reprogrammes the aliens so that their first response is no longer pleasing the humans thereby ending the problem that got them there in the first damn place.\nThe Doctor realises that the robots aren't merely robots any longer, nor should they necessarily be servants for humanity. The humans, like all humans the universe over have a strong sense of entitlement and don't realise that their new settlement is actually built not by the robots but is comprised of robots. Because the robots constitute a new life form, the doctor suggests that the humans and the robots need to find a way to work together to share the same living space. This isn't actually a case of interdependence because the humans need the robots far more than the robots need the humans. The doctor offers to negotiate on the side of the robots and this produces yet another emoji - one that appears as the British pound. This is when the Doctor and Bill head out and unfortunately, they do not destroy the emoji robots. Bill of course wonders if everything is going to be okay and the Doctor admits that he doesn't know but believes that this is out of his hands now that the immediate threat has passed.\nThe previews from next week prove that despite the Doctor's belief that he negotiates with the Tardis to take him where he wants to go, it really doesn't seem to work that way. The Doctor and Bill land in what appears to be Victorian London and something is living below the Thames and Elephants are wandering around freely. Yes, I'm certain that hi-jinks will ensue.\nI can say that I enjoyed this week's episode of Doctor Who, even if it didn't have as much fan service as the season opener. Yes, there were call backs to other Doctors and beloved episodes but they were far more discreet. Smile did however remind us of the fact that the Doctor has been tasked with guarding something, even if it gave us no clue as to what it is. I cannot help but wonder if it will have anything to do with twelves regeneration? Will they draw this out until the end of the season?\nBill is still very much learning who the Doctor is and about time travel. I still find her loads of fun and I love that she seems to have a geek reference for everything. I am still absolutely in love with her magnificent fro and I cannot stop talking about it. It shouldn't be such a big thing to see a Black woman on television with her natural hair but it is because it's such a rarity. This choice had to be intentional on her part and it makes me love Pearl Mackie all the more.","md5":"cda8b85ac86bcf7f4b6cf30c3d35859a","docid":"ccwarc_www.fangsforthefantasy.com_cda8b85ac86bcf7f4b6cf30c3d35859a","rand":0.8567737270711228}

It’s a short walk, maybe a half-mile from the country road high on the Taconic Ridge.\nEdna St. Vincent Millay wrote here and walked these hills for 25 years as she lived out her life at Steepletop, once a 700-acre private preserve of music, gardens, cocktails, dramatics and the bohemian lifestyle for which the poet was known.\nNow for the first time, the Millay Society plans to open Millay’s home at Steepletop to the public, with tours starting May 28. The walk to Millay’s gravesite, which is lined with several passages of her poetry, has been open since 2003, but the white farmhouse where she lived has been closed except for special events or by appointment.\nMillay and her husband Eugen Boissevain moved in 1925 to the ridge in the Columbia Cunty town of Austerlitz overlooking the upper Hudson Valley to the west and the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts just a few miles to the east. She’d already won the Pulitzer Prize and became a major celebrity with cross-country tours and readings that attracted large audiences.\nIn the autumn of 1950, Millay was found dead at the bottom of the farmhouse stairs. She was 58, childless, recently widowed. Her sister, Norma Ellis, lived there for the next three decades, but kept Millay’s things largely undisturbed.\nSociety Executive Director Peter Bergman said the $15 tour will feature Millay’s private suite on the second floor of the farmhouse, including her bedroom and work room and library, with the rooms much as the poet left them. Restoration work is planned on the lower floor. Visitors will be able to walk the 191-acre grounds, which include a pool, patio and bar that later fell into disrepair.\nDavid Walsh visited the grounds with friends last year and had a picnic. “In the old days, graveyards used to be parks where they used to have picnics,” said Walsh. “We turned the picnic into a period piece that tried to represent who she was and how she lived during her romantic days, which were the ’30s and ’40s.\n“It did create an interesting aura. We held glasses of champagne and toasted to her life.”\nWalsh added that “the word bohemian is always used when you talk about her and her parties. It may be overwrought, but it probably applies well to that setting and the outside pool and the outside bar. It clearly looked like a place where the adults played games.”\nMillay also wrote romantic poetry and sonnets. She grew up in Camden, Maine, where a poetry reading at a hotel led to her literary career. Before moving to Steepletop, she lived in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village, where friends included the playwright Eugene O’Neill and journalist Jack Reed. There she wrote what may be her most famous lines:\n“My candle burns at both ends;\/ It will not last the night;\/ But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends– \/It gives a lovely light!”\nIn 2006, 230 acres of the Steepletop estate were sold to New York by the Millay Society to become part of the nearby state forest preserve. Her sister used another piece to establish an adjacent artist colony in the 1970s.\nIf You Go…\nSTEEPLETOP: 436 East Hill Road, Austerlitz, N.Y.; http:\/\/www.millay.org or 518-392-3362.

However, he has so far been denied an Oscar. But what is not, can perhaps still be. Because even though Scott turns 85, he still has a lot planned.\nRidley Scott should have his hands full with \"Napoleon\" around his 85th birthday. The directorial genius behind films like \"Alien\", \"Blade Runner\", \"Gladiator\" and \"The Last Duel\" stages a historical epic with huge fight scenes and an explosive love story.\nAfter shooting started in February on locations in England and Malta, the native Briton is now in the middle of post-production - and the film industry is wondering whether financier Apple TV will bring the eagerly awaited prestige project to cinemas before the end of the year. That would be a prerequisite for \"Napoleon\" to get involved in the 2023 Oscar race.\nScott, who celebrates his 85th birthday on November 30, 2022, has once again assembled a star squad. Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix, who already shone as the imperious Roman Emperor Commodus in \"Gladiator\", now plays the power-hungry Emperor of the French. Vanessa Kirby becomes Empress Josephine.\nNapoleon has always fascinated him, Scott told the cinema portal \"Deadline\" in 2021. \"He emerged from nowhere to rule it all, while also waging a love war with his adulterous wife, Josephine.\"\nScott was already 40 years old when he made his screen debut in 1977 with the historical drama \"The Duellists\" and was promptly awarded a young talent prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Since then he has brought almost 30 feature films to the screen, including cult classics and award-winning works such as \"Alien\", \"Blade Runner\", \"Thelma\nScott has already been nominated three times in the directing category: in 1992 for his road movie \"Thelma\nScott is known for turning his often visually stunning films unusually quickly. In October 2017, Scott told the US magazine \"Vanity Fair\" that he only needed 43 days for the feature film \"All the Money in the World\". \"I'm super fast,\" added the director.\nA little later, Scott reacted quickly to a scandal involving actor Kevin Spacey, who played oil billionaire Jean Paul Getty in the kidnapping drama. After massive allegations of sexual harassment, Scott cut out all the scenes with Spacey and had them re-shot with Christopher Plummer. The film hit theaters on schedule in December of that year.\nScott had come to film in a roundabout way. After studying, including at the Royal College of Arts in London, he worked as a production designer for the BBC. He was soon entrusted with directing episodes of various television series, until he set up his own production company as a commercial filmmaker.\nAfter the feature film debut with \"The Duellists\" (1977), the international breakthrough came two years later with a horror shocker: His dark sci-fi strip \"Alien - The uncanny being from a strange world\" received the Oscar for the best special effects. Scott also starred the then-unknown Sigourney Weaver as the intrepid Ripley. The action aboard the alien-infested spaceship was initially intended to be all about men, but under Scott's direction, Weaver became a forerunner for strong screen heroines.\nWith Harrison Ford as a bounty hunter for renegade replicants in \"Blade Runner\" (1982), Scott succeeded in another future classic. He was on board as a producer for the sequel \"Blade Runner 2049\" by director Denis Villeneuve (2017).\nScott had already founded a production company with his younger brother Tony in the late 1960s. When Scott was immortalized with a star plaque on Hollywood's \"Walk of Fame\" in 2015, he dedicated this award to his brother. Top Gun director Tony Scott committed suicide in 2012 at the age of 68.\nIn 2015, at the age of 77, Ridley Scott entered into his third marriage. The father of three children, who followed him into the film business, married actress Giannina Facio, 17 years his junior, who had a small role in \"Gladiator\" and has since appeared in many Scott projects.\nThe veteran director still has top-class actors queuing up. With Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Adam Driver, he released \"The Last Duel\" in 2021, and a little later the crime drama \"House of Gucci\" with Driver, Lady Gaga and Al Pacino. At the age of 85, Scott has a busy schedule with monumental plans: after \"Napoleon\" there is a \"Gladiator\" sequel.","md5":"5fdf4d8f40ee08c6006279e390943d77","docid":"ccwarc_www.dailynewsen.com_5fdf4d8f40ee08c6006279e390943d77","rand":0.8567737310568199}

These belong to the insect, Anasa tristis, commonly known as Squash bugs. Within 10 days, these eggs would have matured into nymphs, feeding on the sap found in the leaves or stem, with their pierce-sucking mouthparts. If left undisturbed, these nymphs would have disrupted the nutrient and water flow of the host plant, evidenced by yellow and brown spots as well as possible wilting. These nymphs would have developed into adults within 4-6 weeks, overwintering under plant debris or rocks. (They did not!)\nWhile these insects do not carry disease, they can be particularly harmful to young squash and cucumber plants, so limiting the damage is the best control. The use of floating row cover in the seedling stage is recommended, followed by regular inspection of the plants, crushing any eggs and dropping any nymphs and adults into a bucket of soapy water. Trapping adult squash bugs under a piece of wood, where they will group together at night, then into the soapy bucket, also helps. Lastly, it is important to clean up all plant debris at the end of each growing season to reduce overwintering sites.

The most points any driver can score on any given race is 54. The minimum is 4 points for any driver who takes the green flag.\nDismissing the possibility that Dixon could miss a race the rest of the way, the 40-year-old could close out the championship on Friday by winning Race 1 should Newgarden finishes 19th or worse.\nMuch would have to go wrong for Dixon to lose the championship, as no worse than a seventh-place average over the next three races also closes the door on Newgarden -- even if he were to win out the rest of the way.\nThe season finale is scheduled for Oct. 25. on the Streets of St. Petersburg.\nDixon could also close out this weekend but simply preventing Newgarden from making up 23 points over the two races at the Racing Capital of the World.\nDixon won the IndyCar Grand Prix on the IMS Road Course on July 4.\n\"The ultimate goal is to leave this weekend without having to worry about the championship, right,\" Dixon said during an IndyCar press conference on Monday. \"The reality is that it's still going to be very tough. … We don't really change our approach each weekend. I think when you come down to the nitty-gritty of the championship, you are aware of the points and the outcomes a little bit more than you would be, say, at the start or middle part of the season.\n\"We'll focus on doing what we always try to do, and that's win the race. I think if we can win Race 1 or Race 2, that makes things a lot easier. If we can win the both of them, that seals the deal. We'll go in there with that mindset, see what we come out with.\"\nDixon opened the season with three consecutive victories at Texas, Indianapolis and Road America. He also won one of the two races at Gateway in August. His average finish of 4.5 suggests there is little Newgarden can do to prevent the inevitable.\nNewgarden has two wins with an average finish of 6.4. He’s said on multiple occasions that he believes his team is faster than they were last year but have been bitten by bad luck more than Dixon. There’s certainly some merit there.\nA caution came out during their pit stop in the first race at Gateway and that cost Newgarden a chance to win, ultimately finishing 12th. He pit on the same lap as Takuma Sato in the Indianapolis 500, but simply got beat. Dixon finished second that day.\nThat’s been the difference in the championship battle.\n\"I've had years where it just seems like we catch the yellow at the right point all the time,\" Newgarden said. \"This year's been the opposite of that. It's hard to complain about it. It's IndyCar racing. Sometimes it falls your way, sometimes it doesn't.\n\"What I'm hoping is that these last three races we just have the good end of the luck to finish the season.\"\nMeanwhile, Pato O’Ward of Arrow McLaren SP and Colton Herta and Andretti Autosport sit third and fourth in the championship at 118 and 129 points back. While mathematically eligible, both would need to win out and have the frontrunners fail to finish each of the final three races.\nAll told, winning a championship during a season in which IndyCar and its team have had to overcome a pandemic, would make this Astor Cup extra-special for both frontrunners.\n\"I think it would probably be the strangest just I think how the season's gone, the schedule change, the ups and downs,\" Newgarden said. \"Honestly, I'm so thankful that the NTT IndyCar Series and everybody involved were able to get the ball rolling. …\n\"All of them are very unique. They're all very different, at least from my memory. But I think each one becomes that much more meaningful. This one for me would definitely mean the most.\"\nThat was a sentiment shared by Newgarden too.\n\"It would be the strangest,\" Newgarden said. \"I don't know how you're going to forget this year. It's always going to be kind of marked in the book as an odd year, not just from a racing standpoint, but from everything else.\n\"I think because the year has been so strange even personally for everybody, it's going to mark this racing year as certainly a highlight. Every year is different, so individualized. Scott's season is going to be different than ours, everyone else in the championship. Everyone has a different story to tell with how their year has unfolded.\n\"For us it would be a very gratifying championship if we were able to somehow get everything conjured together at the end. It's been a tough year on our car specifically with the yellows, certainly some of the races have fallen. But you got to take the good with the bad, the bad with the good. They're all so different, sometimes things fall for you, sometimes they don't.\nBut yeah, probably a little more gratifying.\"","md5":"136cf6819915f5e207dc0cafccb5422c","docid":"ccwarc_www.autoweek.com_136cf6819915f5e207dc0cafccb5422c","rand":0.8567737323860466}

Root balls are generally bigger, heavier, more developed and bushier than pot plants.\nWhat is ball and burlap?\nA ball and burlap tree is a tree that has been grown past a seedling size (greater than three feet in height) to a sapling (a tree with a trunk diameter at chest level of less than 5 inches) or tree size.\nWhat do you do with a root ball when planting?\nPlace the plant into the planting area or hole at the correct depth, and then backfill the bottom half of the space around the root ball. Tamp the soil lightly with your foot. If amendments are not used, do not tamp so heavily as to compact the soil.\nShould you break up the root ball when planting?\nPlanting holes should be dug twice as wide as the root ball and eight inches deeper than the root ball. ... Breaking up the root ball with hands or a knife prior to setting the plant into the hole helps to encourage root growth into the surrounding soil.\nPlant Root Growing Box Review 2020 - Does It Work?\nWhat if you don't loosen roots before planting?\nIf you plant a pot-bound plant into the ground or into another pot without first loosening the tangled and overgrown roots, they will continue to grow in a circle rather than reaching out into the soil to anchor the plant.\nShould I cut tree roots when planting?\nThe Arboretum recommends shaving the whole root ball of a container-grown tree or shrub before you plant it, Janoski said. Research has shown this helps trees get better established and start growing again more quickly after transplanting.\nHow deep do you plant a root ball?\nThe depth of the planting hole should be approximately two-thirds of the height of the rootball. When placed in the hole, the top one-third of the rootball should be above the surrounding soil. When backfilling, place soil to the top of the rootball and gradually slope it down to the surrounding soil line.\nHow do you break up tree roots before planting?\nAvoid the problem by cutting the roots before planting. Cut into four equidistant sections of the root ball to free up the roots and encourage them to grow outward, then cut an X in the bottom of the rootball. More tips for trouble-free tree planting.\nDo you plant trees with burlap?\nThe majority of tree-planting advice suggests removing burlap, baskets and such after the new tree is safely in the hole. ... Some growers and nurseries say to plant a balled-and-burlapped tree as is, including with the wire basket in place and the burlap intact.\nHow long will a tree last in burlap?\nA balled and burlapped plant can be held out of the ground for several weeks as long as it is sufficiently watered. For periods longer than that, it's best to temporarily heel the root ball into a soil or sawdust bed. But even that situation should be temporary. After about two months, untreated burlap begins to decay.\nWhy are trees wrapped in burlap?\nWrapping with burlap can prevent ice damage. It keeps the branches close together so that the ice can't bend them over.\nHow long does it take for a root ball to work?\nCuttings need 18 to 24 hours of light if they are to root properly, but they must not receive light that is too intense.\nWhat does a healthy root ball look like?\nWhat do healthy roots look like? Healthy roots should be white or tan, succulent, and numerous and long enough to hold the soil in the shape of the pot. If any root tips are visible, they should be white. If the roots are brown and crumbly, that means the plant is unhealthy.\nWhat trees have root balls?\nPalm trees have a fibrous root system with the roots growing shallowly at a depth not exceeding 36 inches deep. They grow horizontally and remain narrow even as the plant grows taller. Roots form a root ball from the origination zone, with some remaining exposed above the ground.\nHow deep should I dig a hole for a tree?\nDig a hole about 2 times as wide as the nursery container and as deep. For 15-gallon or larger trees or shrubs, dig a hole 48 inches in diameter. Be sure that the sides of the hole are fairly vertical and that they have been roughened to allow root penetration.\nHow deep do you dig a hole for a plant?\nUsing your thumb, push a small indentation into the soil. Be careful to not make the hole too deep! Finally, drop the seed inside and sweep the soil over the hole, covering the seed. When digging a hole for a small plant no more than three inches wide, use a bulb auger to dig a hole between six and 12 inches deep.\nCan you plant a tree too high?\nIt's actually impossible to set a tree too high. ... Buy a new quality tree, set it on top of the ground, then add soil around the tree to create a berm. Water reasonably, and the new tree will be happy and grow well. It's an especially good technique to use in heavy clay soil areas where drainage is not particularly good.\nCan tree roots regrow?\nIf a tree doesn't produce root sprouts, then it's unlikely it'll regrow. Instead, the roots will eventually decompose. Trees like pines, oaks, and maples do not grow back from roots. Conversely, some tree species aggressively sprout from the roots even after the tree is cut down and the stump ground up.\nCan I cut a tree root without killing the tree?\nRoot cutting and removal can indeed be accomplished without crippling or killing your tree. ... Trunk Proximity – The closer to the trunk that roots are cut, the more significant and severe the damage will be to your tree. 25% Rule – Never remove more than 25% of a tree's roots. The tree will likely die or fall, or both.\nIs cutting tree roots bad?\nRemoving large tree roots can make the tree unstable or unhealthy later on. If large roots are removed, the tree may not be able to get enough nutrients and water. Also, don't remove roots close or fused to the trunk since these are critical to the tree's structure.\nShould you loosen soil before planting?\nSoil in the planting area should be loose and easy to work with. ... Work it into the soil to loosen the soil before planting. Alternately, spread a 2- to 4-inch layer of organic matter over the entire gardening area and till it into the soil to improve the tilth of the soil before planting.\nIs it OK to trim roots when transplanting?\nPruning the roots will encourage the plant to produce a flush of new feeder roots. The goal is to allow the plant to develop new feeder roots within the zone of the future root ball that will be moved. This will reduce the amount of transplant shock the plant experiences.\nWhat happens if you break a root of a plant?\nIf some large roots are torn, such as is you cut into the soil with a sharp tool, your plant may show a slow decline in growth for up to several years. ... Extensive damage to large roots reduces the plant's lifespan, especially if it is a tall plant. Trees, in particular, need their large roots to anchor them.","md5":"4961845c74fe6cd9aad772758a4ea5ef","docid":"ccwarc_moviecultists.com_4961845c74fe6cd9aad772758a4ea5ef","rand":0.8567737327556639}

{"content":"A prime example of Phillip Surrey's signature nocturnal urban scenes, “Three Women Threatened by Automobiles” is alive with activity. Three barefoot women run across a street, as the headlights of three cars shine on them and illuminate the composition. The distinct sombreness and stillness to the painter’s work has been compared to the mood of Giorgio de Chirico’s piazzas and Edward Hopper’s American street scenes, and has established a significant rank for Surrey in Canadian art history. In this painting, the building in the right foreground with glass windows at the corner brings to mind the night scenes of Hopper, and the emptiness of the land behind the figures and street lamps recall the settings of de Chirico’s compositions. A skilled interpreter of both physical and psychological space, Surrey was known for depicting Montreal’s streets and their inhabitants. His studies of isolation within society add emotional depth to these urban scenes.\nPhilip Surrey, a founding member of the Contemporary Arts Society, was a figurative painter with an enduring interest in human subjects within urban nightscapes. For most of his career, Surrey used Montreal as his stage, arranging lighting and figures - most often pedestrians - in compositions that revealed both the gregarious nature and the solitude of humanity. A friend and student of Frederick Varley, Surrey was also closely tied to many of the most important Montreal artists and writers of the 1930s and 1940s.\nPhilip Surrey began his art training in Winnipeg at age sixteen, when he took an apprenticeship at Brigdens commercial art firm. There, he met Fritz Brandtner. In the evenings, he took classes at the Winnipeg School of Art under LeMoine FitzGerald and George Overton. It was at this time that he started painting the streets and people of Winnipeg after dark, by the light of streetlamps and restaurants. He moved to Vancouver in 1929 and took a job as a commercial artist at Cleland-Kent Engraving. In night classes at the Vancouver School of Decorative and Applied Arts, he studied with Frederick Varley and Jock Macdonald. Surrey left Vancouver in 1936 and spent three months at New York's Art Students League, studying under Frank Vincent Dumond. The following year, he settled in Montreal and found work at the Standard newspaper. He continued to paint in evenings and on weekends and became immersed in the art scene, rekindling his friendship with Brandtner and befriending John Lyman, Goodridge Roberts, Jori Smith and Jean Palardy.\nPhilip Surrey was awarded the Centennial Medal (1967). He held an honorary doctorate form Concordia University (1981), and was a member of the Order of Canada (1982).","md5":"0af981bc0d8f247b4d76b5e1ebde83a5","docid":"redpajama_c4_0af981bc0d8f247b4d76b5e1ebde83a5","rand":0.8567737442375927}
{"content":"Dr. Gordon Hasick to help fund the Phase Contrast Study. This initial money was important to activate further support of three other organizations that came in for the balance of the funding.\nFor other supporters and foundations, it is important for them to know that we come to the table with a certain amount of financial resources to fund our projects. We need to demonstrate this capability first before others are willing to invest in our programs. One of the corporate sponsors sent us a cheque for $25,000 and it was listed as “an investment”. I look at the money we raise as an investment in our future.\nQ: How have you initiated the program in your office?\nA: When I initiated the Small Steps Program in our office last year, for me it wasn’t about asking for something that directly influenced me personally. It was an invitation to support our work as a whole.\nAfter 30+ years of being involved with the NUCCA work, I have a deep respect and appreciation for the power of correcting the Atlas Subluxation Complex. A great gift to me was the opportunity to study and learn from Dr. Gregory. He is still my mentor through the teaching and writings he has left for me and others. I went through the certification process with him and look back now and see the depth of wisdom that he shared. It has taken many years to fully appreciate this gift.\nThirty years into practice and I continue to find it even more of a privilege to be able to take care of people by attending to the Atlas Subluxation Complex. The miraculous changes I have seen for many people, including my own life, have profoundly influenced this deep sense of appreciation. Asking for money to support our research that will help us better understand the mechanism and physiological benefits of the NUCCA work are of great value to me.\nInitiating the program in our office became simple. There is a small office poster we created (that is available online at the NUCCA website under downloads) and I put a copy of this poster in every room. When my patients are brought back to wait, the staff would simply ask them to review this annual fundraising campaign. After we were done with their clinic visit, they would check out at the front desk where the staff would simply ask if they would like to make a donation to research.\nFor many patients, when asked whether they would like to donate to research, broke into an extensive conversation about how it had saved their life. The whole waiting room got to benefit from the conversation and testimonial of how important their care was.\nQ: What good things have developed from this program in your office, and others?\nA: Perhaps the greatest benefit of the Small Steps Program was experienced in these conversations that took place in the practice!\nThis seemed to breed a real strong energy within the practice for the month that we ran the program. My stats revealed that it was one of our busiest months of the year! I attribute that increase in activity to the increased energy and the positive conversations that the patients, staff and I were all having.\nI believe that to be successful at fundraising, one has to have their heart and commitment attached to whatever cause they are fundraising for. For me, my heart is in this work and it is easy to get behind the request.\nI have been very surprised by the responses from people in my practice. Some patients give $5, but that $5 was like $5000 for them. As a result of the conversations during the program last year, one of my patients has made an annual commitment of $5000 and wants to make it an ongoing relationship, not just a one-time event. Other patients would give $50, $100, $500 or even $1000. You never really know what some people are willing to support until an invitation is extended to them.\nOne of the best things that has happened from running this program in our office is the greater awareness and gratitude for the work that we do. The difference that it makes in so many peoples lives is profoundly seen in the stories and conversations that take place around the research fundraising campaign. I really got that my staff, my patients and myself are deeply committed to insuring that future generations continue to benefit from this amazing work.\nOne of the greatest challenges in this fundraising process is to overcome is the hesitancy to ask for help. Patients come to us every day asking for help and we are more than willing to offer that support through the care we provide. In turn, we might ask them for help and support in a way that will help sustain our work for the future generations.\nDr. Gregory left us a great legacy and one that deserves ongoing respect and support. I encourage everyone to be involved in the small steps program and to give it a try to see what is possible for your office. The energy, the conversations, the intent, may surprise you.\nPlease take time to participate.\nThanks to Dr. Gordon Hasick, for taking time out of his busy schedule to tell us why he is so passionate about the Small Steps to Success Program.\nThis entry was posted\non Tuesday, November 2nd, 2010 at 1:45 pm and is filed under Events, Interviews, Research.\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.","url":"http:\/\/thenuccablog.com\/can-small-steps-really-make-a-difference\/","timestamp":"2017-05-23 03:26:39","dump":"CC-MAIN-2017-22","segment":"1495463607046.17","md5":"6b8942dd59c9ec688a3bd7e34ac49c4b","docid":"falcon_thenuccablog.com_6b8942dd59c9ec688a3bd7e34ac49c4b","rand":0.8567737478097307}

That’s evident from the war in Novorossiya, in the Donbass. It’s destroyed schools, hospitals, and maternity homes… it’s damaged churches, as a church and its belfry with its shining cupola is an easy target for a gun-layer. One Cossack, who built a church with his own hands near Lutugino for twenty years now, told me that, for a whole month, Ukrainian artillerymen believed that a patriot observer was in the belfry and kept shelling the church. He said, “God preserved me, no shell hit the target”. However, the war destroyed some churches down to their very foundations. It affects all churches, not only Orthodox ones. In Pervomaisk, shelling almost completely destroyed the Baptist church. In Novosvetlovka, several shells hit the cupola of an Orthodox church, but its undergoing restoration now. A monstrous thing happened in that church. They used it to imprison the people of the town. They locked the locals in there for some time, and, later, the junta forces killed several [patriot fighters] with no investigation or trial, just because they had arms in their hands. They took them prisoner, executed them, and buried them a few metres from the church. In this connection, what should an Orthodox priest do? Does he have to favour a particular side? He sees shells flying into his church, wounded [fighters] and suffering civilian come to him. What must he do?\nMetropolitan Ilarion Alfeyev:\nAn Orthodox priest should identify with those who suffer. The Church is always on the side of those subjected to violence and aggression. The Church shouldn’t take sides in a political or civic confrontation. What do we see in the Ukraine now? Believers in our Church find themselves on both sides of the barricades. This has been the case since the January events.\nRogatkin:\nSo, would you say that two forms of division bedevil the Church? Firstly, the Ukrainian schism divided it, as the self-proclaimed Patriarch Filaret led away a part of the flock. Now, the civil war divides it.\nMetropolitan Ilarion:\nWe shouldn’t say that there’s division in the Church. As for the schism, we say that some people separated themselves or fallen away from the Church for this-or-that political reason. Indeed, from the very beginning, the Ukrainian schism was a political project aimed at dividing the Russian and Ukrainian peoples. More than twenty years ago, they divided the Church; more precisely, they divided Christians because, I repeat, we never say that there can be division within the Church itself. We say that some people, groups of people, or hierarchs fall away from the Church. Today, there are divisions in Ukrainian Orthodoxy. Firstly, the people divided according to a doctrinal principle, then, some attempted to divide them according to linguistic and political principles, now, this division led to a civic confrontation victimising civilians. This is what the most terrible thing is. The canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church\/Moscow Patriarchate (UPTs\/MP) doesn’t take a particular side in this conflict. She doesn’t say that we’re with the Ukrainian Army or that we’re with the [patriot fighters], or that we’re with this-or-that political force. On the one hand, the Church should be above political fights, on the other, it should stand together with those who suffer, with the victims.\nDo you remember those pictures from the Maidan when many Uniate priests took the side of the Euromaidantsy? They came forward with crosses and urged the crowd to attack the Berkut. It was so.\nFrom the very beginning, the Uniates fanned this conflict, for they identified with one of the conflicting parties. I spoke about it openly at the Synod of Catholic Bishops in Rome, in the presence of Pope Francisco. After that, all the Catholic media, especially in America, most of all the Uniates, lambasted me. I stated a very simple thing… the Church isn’t supposed to participate in political struggle. The Church can’t and mustn’t take sides in a conflict because by doing so, firstly, we help to promote that conflict, and, secondly, we marginalise people, regardless of their number… people who belong to our Church, but take an alternative political stand. In general, the Church shouldn’t take any political position.\nHowever, it’s precisely a political conflict. If we recall, the Svoboda bloc seized churches belonging to the UPTs\/MP. They handed them over to the schismatics or to the Uniates. What we saw in Maidan isn’t new at all. It’s been going on for twenty years. They shout, “Hang the Moskali!” They knocked down the doors of Orthodox churches and dragged out priests. One priest in the Western Ukraine told me that they used chains. He himself sat almost in chains for several days. Another priest from Rovno told me that in the 90s when he was 12, they seized his church and struck his father on the head. He heard them saying, “What shall we do with the priest’s kid? Let’s hang him; otherwise, when he grows up, he’ll turn into a Moskal priest”. He was only a kid, why, he didn’t even know where Moscow was!\nParadoxically, the Uniates, whose head is in Rome, positions themselves as the Ukrainian national church. The nationalistic media issues propaganda that the UPTs\/MP, which comprises a majority of Orthodox believers in the Ukraine, is a Church governed from Moscow. That means that it’s OK for the leadership of a national church to be in Rome, but not in Moscow. Actually, the UPTs\/MP is fully independent. The Patriarch of Moscow and all the Russias doesn’t govern the UPTs\/MP; it isn’t accountable to him either financially or administratively. We only preserve a spiritual relation. For instance, we’ll be ready to help when, God willing, they begin to restore churches in the Donbass. Certainly, we’d help in all possible ways. However, that has nothing to do with the internal financial life of the UPTs\/MP. In this respect, it’s fully independent. The UPTs\/MP elects its own bishops… Moscow doesn’t approve the nominations. The Patriarch of Moscow and all the Russias only vets the election of the Metropolitan of Kiev and all the Ukraine. Nevertheless, this is more spiritual than actual.\nWe cherish this relationship because our spiritual unity is over a thousand years old, coming from the baptismal font of the Holy Prince Vladimir. This year, we’ll mark the millennium of the death of Holy Prince Vladimir. In 2013, we celebrated the 1,025th anniversary of the Baptism of Rus. At one time, Rus was one state. For the last thousand years, new political boundaries arose more than once, but that doesn’t mean that we should divide the Church into ever-smaller parts every time that there’s some new boundaries. If we’d done it in Africa, there wouldn’t be a united Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa, but 54 Lilliputian Orthodox Churches. The Patriarchate of Antioch and all the East, which unites believers in Syria and Lebanon, would’ve had division as well. The Church doesn’t unite people on ethnic grounds. We cherish our unity; especially today, it manifests its relevance, soundness, and importance. When politicians divide a society into warring parties, when soldiers liquidate people, the Church seeks to unite and reconcile all.\nNotably, the Ukrainian religious field is rather mixed. There are so many all kinds of sects… so many preachers bringing in crazy ideas. They enjoy respect, while the UPTs\/MP is a pariah. They hate it and everybody mistreats it. That’s politics, nothing else.\nThe UPTs\/MP is a victim of propaganda and political struggle; in the combat zone, it’s also a victim of the military conflict. You gave some examples. We have information that, regrettably, grows with each new report… 3 priests of the UPTs\/MP are dead, 62 churches in Donbas suffered damage, some destroyed, others with serious damage, still others need restoration. All this supports what you said… there’s a purposeful struggle against the canonical Church; the Church is under attack. Really, churches are easy targets. Today, a great tragedy unfolds before our eyes. We can’t take it as a coincidence. If there’s a massed artillery bombardment, it may accidentally hit churches. However, if we see so many churches destroyed or damaged, it means that there’s a purposeful campaign. We can’t see it differently.\nThat’s true, considering that the people there are believers. When Ukrainian paratroopers left the Lugansk Airport, the [patriot fighters] showed us what they left after them. Together with packed rations, there lay heaps of Uniate books. There were also Gospels and Bibles, that is, they’d all been parachuted specially for them.\nWhen I openly state that the Uniates took one side of the conflict, that they stood behind the events in Maidan, that they were brought by bus from the Western Ukraine to ramp up interethnic hostility, they say… “No, it isn’t a political confrontation. This is how we express our political opinions”. This is what the Uniates say. We’re not at all happy with their answer. Indeed, if the Church has a call to reconcile people, it means that we should be with all those who suffer; we shouldn’t take a particular side; we shouldn’t say, “These people are ours and these people aren’t”.\nHow do matters stand with the Pochaev Lavra? It’s one of the most significant holy sites of the UPTs\/MP in the Western Ukraine. I remember how in February, just a week before the events in Maidan, they came to assault the gates to the Lavra. How do matters stand there now?\nThere were such attempts, but the Pochaev Lavra guards canonical Orthodoxy. There was an attempt to seize the Kievo-Pecherskaya Lavra as well, but these two monasteries keep strong the monastic spirit. The monks are well aware of what the canonical Church is and what the schism is. In the time of the iconoclastic heresy, the monks stood up in defence of holy icons. Today, our monks guard canonical Orthodoxy. I believe that the Kievo-Pecherskaya Lavra, the Pochaev Lavra, and other monasteries will stand firm for the faith and canons of the Church. The conduct of monks during the Maidan events can serve as an example. When barricades went up and some prepared armed confrontation, monks of the Tithe Monastery in Kiev came out to stand under a torrential rain between the two warring groups in order to prevent them from fighting. I think such should typify the position of the Church and of Orthodox monastics.\nOver the last twenty years, how many churches of the UPTs\/MP did they seize or destroy in this struggle?\nIf we speak of the parishes that recently transferred to the so-called “Patriarchate of Kiev”, according to them, there are 30 such parishes, but according to our information, there are 10. However, we should realise how this actually takes place. It isn’t due to free popular will, as a rule, its only done under very serious pressure. Let me give you an example. Recently, a declaration in Rovno Oblast appeared on the establishment of a united Ukrainian Local Church. It appeared under pressure from the local authorities. Amongst others, a bishop of the UPTs\/MP signed it. Immediately, it raised many questions… will a united Ukrainian Orthodox Church arise within Rovno Oblast? Alternatively, is the Uniate bishop ready to disobey the Pope in order to join the projected united Ukrainian Orthodox Church?\nThat is, not everybody understands what they sign.\nThey either don’t understand or yield to pressure. As a result, very soon after, the UPTs\/MP bishop withdrew his signature; the Uniate bishop followed suit, whilst the Oblast governor got the boot. That’s the end of the story for you. In this case, there was very serious pressure. As for popular will, we saw a report about people making rounds with ballot boxes. They come to some baba who hardly can hear what they say and ask her, “Are you Ukrainian?” ”Yes, I am”. “Are you for Kiev?” “Yes, I am”. “Sign the paper”. “Your relatives, where are they?” “They aren’t here”. “Can you sign for them?” “Yes, I can”. You see, it is simply profanation. That’s how they transfer parishes of the canonical Church to these schismatic associations. It isn’t widespread, of course, but it happens. We should hope that it’d end. However, it’ll only end when peace returns to the Ukraine. We pray for it at every Divine Liturgy. Not only the UPTs\/MP, but also all of the multinational MP prays that peace may return to the Ukrainian land. It’s our strongest desire. At the beginning of this New Year 2015, we ask God for that, we wish that He’ll send us this much-desired peace.\nPravmir\nhttp:\/\/www.pravmir.com\/metropolitan-hilarion-church-not-political-position\/#ixzz3PXjA2ezT\nIt’s clear that all parties who associate with Uniates in these times of great emergency are anti-Christian elements… we must treat them as such.

He told Interfax-Religion, “I’d draw your attention to the fact that seizures of UPTs\/MP parishes are made solely on the initiative of the so-called UPTs\/KP under ‘Patriarch’ F A Denisenko. They’ve already taken six of our parishes, and several more are under threat”. He said that nobody asks the parishioners what they want, “They justify such thefts at public meetings, which are attended by interested parties, most of whom aren’t parishioners. Even those who advocate close contact with the UPTs\/KP such as Archpriest Georgi Kovalenko (head of the Synodal outreach department of the UPTs\/MP) recognise that there’s a problem. That’s the first time that I agreed with him over the last six months. Reality shows us that the Banderovtsy don’t understand what ‘good’ means. The situation with Fr Vladimir Maretsky showed us this once again… they arrested him illegally in Kharkov, the protests of human rights advocates couldn’t free him, only a general prisoner exchange set him free. Because of things like this, it’s time to hit back at the UPTs\/KP… we must recognise this group as an extremist organisation and close down its parishes in the Russian Federation and Novorossiya”.\nRusskaya Vesna\nhttp:\/\/rusvesna.su\/recent_opinions\/1410782910\nBoth the UPTs\/KP and UGKTs are organisations “owned” by Langley. Therefore, the Russian Federation and Novorossiya should ban them immediately, as a matter of state security. They should send their clergy out of the country and close their parishes. All lay activists should go, too. That would solve the problem. The Uniates and schismatics hate Russia, so, no one should allow them to be in a situation to harm the Motherland. No one should harm or kill them… that’s descending to their low level. The Russian Federation and Novorossiya must expel them… they’re open agents of the American special services, and that’s that. There is NO compromise here. You don’t negotiate with an adder…\nComments Off on R A Silantyev Sez So-Called UPTs\/KP Extremist Organisation\n6 September 2014.

You can tell the measure of a person by the enemies that they attract… look at VVP’s enemies! Need I say anything more?\nReal Orthodox people should have nothing to do with “Ukrainian Orthodox” or “Ukrainian Catholics”… they live in a surreal world of their own imagination, and issue outright insanity as public statements, as this proves. Cross yourself, pass the jug, and stay away from such sorts. It’s the safest policy…\nOn Saturday, “Patriarch” F A Denisenko, the head of the so-called “Patriarchate of Kiev and all the Ukraine, said that President V V Putin fell under Satan’s spell and faces eternal damnation unless he repents. He squarely blamed the Russian leader for the war in the Ukraine. Canonical Orthodoxy doesn’t recognise the Kiev Patriarchate, it broke away from Moscow in 1992 after the fall of the USSR Union and the Ukrainian declaration of independence. This church (sic) is a rival of the Moscow Patriarchate, which is closely linked to Putin (sic), strongly supports Ukrainian nationhood, and the Kiev government’s struggle to defeat pro-Russian separatists (sic) in the eastern Ukraine (sic).\nDenisenko said, invoking the Biblical character who killed his brother Abel, “With great regret I must now say publicly that among the rulers of this world … there has appeared a new Cain, not by his name but by his deeds. Like the first fratricide of history Cain, these deeds show that the aforementioned ruler has fallen under the action of Satan”. Denisenko issued the statement, entitled A New Cain, on the first full day of a ceasefire between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels. At least 2,600 people have died in fighting in eastern Ukraine since it erupted in April.\nPutin is a baptised Orthodox Christian and has forged close ties with Russia’s Orthodox Church, seeing it as a valuable ally in his battle with what he sees as a decadent Western world. Denisenko, who recently took over the Kiev Patriarchate {this shows that the author of this piece knows NOTHING about REAL Orthodoxy… he’s like Dreher and Freddie M-G: editor}, said Putin had deliberately stoked the conflict in the Ukraine by sending mercenaries, troops, and weapons across the border and had spread lies via Russian media about what was really happening. Putin denies sending Russian troops into Ukraine or arming the separatists (sic), despite what Kiev and its Western backers say is overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\nDenisenko said, “This ruler is cynically lying, saying his country is not a party to the conflict in Ukraine, though he did everything to foment the conflict and maintain it. He calls himself a brother to the Ukrainian people, but in fact according to his deeds, he has really become the new Cain, shedding the brotherly blood and entangling the whole world with lies”. Denisenko urged Orthodox faithful to pray that Putin would “come to his senses”. Otherwise, he added, he’d face “an ignominious end and eternal damnation in hell”.\nAndrew Heavens\nhttp:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/putin-under-satans-influence-leader-kiev-orthodox-church-142555843.html\nThis is crackbrained nonsense. However, note well that the “Ukrainian Orthodox” or “Ukrainian Catholics” will refuse to condemn it. They BLESS the junta murders… if that doesn’t prove to you that they’re not part of Christ’s Church, nothing will. Tserkovnost will tell you that “Ukrainian Orthodox” or “Ukrainian Catholics” are, at best, questionable (and, in the case of the Uniates, heretical to boot). Always keep a sense of “Church” in your heart… for the Church is Christ’s Body… not all who cry, “Lord, Lord”, will win the Kingdom of Heaven. Our Lord Christ Himself said so…\nNote well the hatred gushed forth by “Ukrainians”. Such rot has been incessant since 1991… actually, it started much earlier, as anyone who’s had contact with “Ukrainian Orthodox” or “Ukrainian Catholics” can testify. Why does the innocent majority in these bodies put up with such arrant shit? Mark this down well… the innocent majority in these groups would NOT defend you if the nationalist nutters started to attack you. That’s a fact and that’s why you should have as little to do with such sorts as humanly possible. They’ve sold out to hate… and that’s that.\nComments Off on 6 September 2014.

{"content":"OK. About to try this online test to se how suitable I am for online learning.\nI have to complete two or more of these types of questionnaires and then reflect on their suitability and identify similarities between them.\nOK… My results are in… And I am ready to learn online apparently. Well, I should hope so as that is precisely what I am doing here on #ocTEL.\nYour Test of Online Learning Success Results\nIf your overall score is:\n190 – 201: You’re!\n0 – 177:.\nSo, my reflections on the tests will be in the comments.\nOk. I have completed the test and am ready to learn online. But what did I have to do to prove that I was ready? A series of judgement statements like “Can I move files easily on my computer” put into a Likert scale. I have no idea what the measure for success is in qualifyinf my statement other than my own experience. So Person A who can create a new folder on the computer in this example and move a file from one location to another might “Strongly Agree” that they can move files easily on their computer… However, compare that to person B who has complex filing systems and indexes that cross reference and produce “Smart” filing structures for easy identification and tagging files with colours and metadata…. then Person A is a complete novice and has not even scratched the surface of knowing how to move files around on their computer.\nIs the concept of moving files around on your computer even a skill that is worth assessing? Perhaps a better question is do I know how to locate a file on my computer once I have saved it? Can I search for and find a file using the computer operating system tools? It is about asking the right question and identifying the level of competency required.\nIn the case of moving files, it would be better to give some examples of what basic level of competency is e.g. level 1 = Save a file in a location. Go back to that location on your computer and find the file you saved.\nLevel 2 = Move file from one folder to another. Copy a file from one folder to another and know the difference between the two.\nLevel 3 = Make a link or shortcut to a file and place it on your desktop.\nLevel 4 = Use a search tool to find a file on your computer\nLevel 5 = Create smart folders that automatically pull in content from all over your computer in to one place based on specific criteria.","url":"http:\/\/www.ilearninguk.com\/octel-explorer-badge-activity-1-5-test-1\/","timestamp":"2021-02-25 10:45:31","dump":"CC-MAIN-2021-10","segment":"1614178350706.6","md5":"ff90da68961305cc30edb4f97313b1a5","docid":"falcon_www.ilearninguk.com_ff90da68961305cc30edb4f97313b1a5","rand":0.8567737606317071}
{"content":"Auckland Council has welcomed a decision by the North Shore District Court to fine a property owner for not ensuring his swimming pool was properly fenced.\nLi Yu was fined $250 plus court costs for failing to fence a swimming pool at a property he owned in Greenhithe. The swimming pool, at the unoccupied home, was full of water and easily accessible from the street. The property neighboured a day care.\nAuckland Council’s Manager Compliance – Building Control, Sally Grey, says the conviction is a reminder that the council will take enforcement action if people fail to comply with swimming pool fencing rules.\n“In this case the pool was completely unfenced and full of water, which is an unacceptable risk to young children in the community.\"\n“We endeavour to work with owners to make sure pools are fenced and safe, but if people are consistently ignoring our requests to make their swimming pools compliant, we will pursue it through the courts.\n“While the fine is small, we hope this serves as a reminder for people to check their pools are safe at all times.”\nUnsupervised access via faulty gates and fences is a leading cause of children drowning or being injured in pools. Make sure fences, self-closing gates and latches are maintained and working correctly.","url":"https:\/\/ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz\/news\/2016\/12\/fine-for-non-compliant-pool-fence\/","timestamp":"2022-06-25 22:45:03","dump":"CC-MAIN-2022-27","segment":"1656103035636.10","md5":"a0d3bb41fa64c05e7b0f1d983e7db2b9","docid":"falcon_ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz_a0d3bb41fa64c05e7b0f1d983e7db2b9","rand":0.856773761236057}

It is a popular form of gambling that has been used for hundreds of years and is widely used in the United States.\nMany state governments have authorized lotteries as a means of raising funds to support public programs or improve the infrastructure. They have been successful in this endeavor, but they are also a controversial issue.\nUnlike other forms of gambling, lottery revenues are generally not taxed. This allows the state to profit from the activity without increasing taxes on its citizens or reducing services for them. The question therefore is whether lotteries are an appropriate activity for a state to undertake.\nThe popularity of lottery games has grown significantly over the years, and they have become a major source of revenue for many states. These revenues have helped fund public schools, roads, and other vital public programs. However, they have also caused problems, including the alleged regressive effects on lower-income groups and the promotion of compulsive gambling.\nCritics argue that lottery revenues are not in the best interest of the state, and that they should not be promoted. They point out that they are a form of gambling and can be addictive, that the odds of winning are extremely small, and that there are better ways to spend the money than on the lottery. They also argue that the profits from lottery games should be earmarked for other uses.\nMoreover, they argue that lotteries should be run as a regulated business and not be considered a political tool. As an example, the Oregon lottery was criticized for generating large amounts of revenue during state financial crises.\nThe lottery industry has evolved significantly over time, and there are now many more game options and more types of tickets. In addition, the amount of money that can be won by playing a single game has increased significantly. This has led to a number of new games, such as video poker and keno.\nIn addition to monetary revenues, lottery organizations have traditionally returned money to bettors in the form of prizes. Prizes can be in the form of cash, merchandise, or a combination of the two. In the United States, for example, most lottery prize pools return a substantial percentage of the pool to bettors.\nOne way to increase your chances of winning is to buy more tickets. Buying a second ticket doubles your odds of winning, and purchasing a third ticket increases your chances by a factor of five. This strategy can be particularly helpful if you want to win a huge jackpot.\nAnother way to increase your chances of winning is to select uncommon numbers. These are numbers that are not commonly chosen, and can be based on dates, such as birthdays or anniversaries. Often, people select these kinds of numbers because they are considered “lucky.”\nThe most common way to increase your chances of winning is to play a variety of games. Different games have different odds of winning, so make sure to read the odds before you decide which ones to play. This will help you choose the games that have the highest odds of winning.","md5":"70ada0269355f74294f9e50b5157cd9c","docid":"ccwarc_lonehilldentaloffice.com_70ada0269355f74294f9e50b5157cd9c","rand":0.8567737622625095}
{"content":"WINE CAVE DIGGER\nBrian Simmons, general manager of Bacchus Caves, Napa, Calif.\nBy Brian Simmons\n(FORTUNE Magazine) – I WAS IN NEVADA GOLD MINING FOR 12 YEARS. When things got slow in the gold market, this sounded interesting, and now I've been doing it for three years. We build big caves for commercial wineries to make their wine, sell, and store it. The biggest was 19,000 square feet and took a year and a half. We also dig personal caves, which are usually about 1,000 square feet. It's a niche market--people want caves for all sorts of things, like dining rooms, movie-screening areas, to hold parties down there.\nWe generally need some type of hill to build a real cave, and you need to have a decent combination of rock and soil. Sometimes the ground is too hard for our equipment to cut, so we blast it with dynamite, but most of the time we use a large cutting machine. Gravity is really the thing we're overcoming. How fast we go depends on ground conditions. The tunnels are 15 feet wide, and you may be able to advance the tunnel up to 20 feet a day, but occasionally it's as little as three feet. It's pitch-dark in there, so we use construction string lighting. I wear a light on my head, and I can't live without it.\nI'll spend around ten hours in the cave a day--I really don't mind being in the dark. It's incredibly gratifying because you're beating Mother Nature and gravity on a minute-by-minute basis. A lot of the personal caves are in cities like L.A. That can be a little tough--everyone wants things tailored to them. Plus, I'm used to being out in the hills. I get claustrophobic in the big cities. Would I ever build a cave for myself? I've always thought that a subterranean or partially subterranean house would be a great thing. I don't know how fancy I'll make it, but it's a great use of space on a hillside. -- Julia Boorstin","md5":"dbdb8f958bf828684cca52fb0aaccfd8","docid":"redpajama_common-crawl_dbdb8f958bf828684cca52fb0aaccfd8","rand":0.8567737628713952}
